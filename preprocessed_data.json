        "article": "cnn the stark video of a south carolina officer gunning down an apparently unarmed black man as he ran away with his back to police has prompted an equally fastmoving reaction by officials and the public alike the video is being dissected frame by frame by authorities and media outlets all in an effort to reconstruct what exactly happened between north charleston police officer michael slager a fiveyear employee of that force and walter scott 50 slager 33 was charged tuesday with firstdegree murder after firing eight shots at scott killing him slager is also now terminated from the force north charleston mayor keith summey said wednesday added police chief eddie driggers on wednesday i watched the video and i was sickened by what i saw and i have not watched it since both scott and slager had once served in the us coast guard with scotts service occurring 198486 and slagers 200309 scott was a father of four slager is a father to two stepchildren and his wife is eight months pregnant heres what we know of the fatal shooting  slager pulled scott over at 933 am saturday for a broken taillight according to authorities chief driggers described the incident as traffic stop of an individual who had a minor infraction on his vehicle a brake light being out a foot chase then occurred a police report said the video taken by a passerby doesnt show any vehicle rather slager and scott are on a path or roadway in a parklike setting bordered partly by a chainlink fence the video was shot over and through the fence the officer said that walter ran from the vehicle during the traffic stop scott family attorney l chris stewart said according to the police report scott did not comply with the officers demands scotts brother anthony scott said his brother had trouble with child support and had an outstanding warrant against him but that his sibling wasnt prone to violence that very well could have been the reason for running from police not to be arrested for the warrant that was on him for child support anthony scott said the video begins by showing a second or two of an apparent struggle between the officer and suspect the officer contended he used a taser stun gun on scott and that scott tried to take that weapon authorities said but when anthony scott saw the video he was convinced the officer lied he told cnn there was not a struggle for the taser anthony scott said i didnt believe my brother would have done that anyway the video shows walter scott running away with his back to the officer as he does so two objects fall one falls behind the officer and the other falls between the two men to anthony scott the videotape shows his brother was running for his life away from the officer to escape more of the taser i think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot no one would have thought that scott said as walter scott runs away the officer pulls his service pistol and fires eight times the video shows as the shots are being fired scott keeps running away from the officer the video shows scott then falls later in the video when the officer approaches scotts body he drops a dark object next to the man its not clear whether it is the taser its also unknown whether scott took the officers taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body immediately after scott was shot according to the video someone yells put your hands behind your back scott motionless and facedown on the ground is handcuffed it was slager who apparently called police dispatch 226 to dispatch shots fired subject is down he grabbed my taser slager told the dispatcher according to a transcript provide by broadcastifycom the dispatcher notes that the subject is down at 938 am according to the transcript about 90 seconds after saying that scott grabbed his taser the officer describes scott as unresponsive and having wounds to the chest right thigh and buttocks according to the transcript the location of the shooting is behind a pawn shop the officer tells the dispatcher a police report identified that shop as mega pawn according to cnn affiliate wcivtv in charleston slager initially said through his attorney david aylor that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures however aylor later told cnn that he was no longer representing the officer today i withdrew my representation of michael slager this is a terrible tragedy that has impacted our community aylor said in a statement later anthony scotts mother calls him and says his brother was tasered at a traffic stop anthony scott goes to the scene and finds it curious to see police tape around his brothers vehicle and the officers vehicle he asks officers what happened no one replies then anthony scotts nephew tells him that my brother is gone anthony scott said and at that i lost it anthony scott said an officer also apprises him later of what happened anthony scott is shown the video for the first time on sunday my reaction to it was that we have to get ahold of the video and that this was key evidence key evidence in the case anthony scott said we had to get it the country had to see this he felt a little bit of anger and happy at the same time the brother said based on what the video was showing it was discrediting what the officer had initially stated anthony scott said the nation did indeed see the video  and was stunned by its revelations authorities saw it too slager was denied bail at a bond hearing tuesday night wciv reported i have two stepchildren and one on the way slager told a magistrate through video conferencing if found guilty of murder slager could face up to life in prison or death the city of north charleston will continue to cover the insurance for the pregnancy of slagers wife the mayor said an autopsy on scott performed sunday revealed that mr scott sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and the manner of death was ruled homicide  charleston county coroner rae h wooten said wednesday anthony scott said wednesday that his brother was shot in the back four times the autopsy findings support familys claims that the police used excessive use  even if the video never existed anthony scott said eventually we would have gotten to this point but not this fast anthony scott said there is absolutely no way to cover that up he added about the gunshot wounds to the back north charleston police arent involved in the investigation into the shooting and have turned the matter over to the south carolina law enforcement division the fbi is also investigating anthony scott and family attorney stewart believe the object that officer slager relocated at the crime scene is the taser they said stewart also accused the officer of trying to plant evidence by moving the taser and placing it close to walter scotts body a slowmotion analysis of the tape along with highlights of key moments supports the familys stepbystep interpretation of the officers actions including the handling of the taser the attorney alleged he drops the taser kills mr scott walks all the way back picks something up off the ground from where he was taking the shots comes back to the body waits a second drops it on the ground and then pretends to be recovering it and putting it back on his holster stewart said referring to the taser why we believe that is because it fits in line with his initial report of what happened out there i mean he just committed a murder he needed something a justifiable reason to use lethal force and thats the only thing he could think of stewart said neither officer slager or his attorney could be reached for comment wednesday authorities arent commenting on the details of the case

        "article": "washington cnn early clinton campaign calculations the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns a gop ticket for the generations and republican calendar concerns filled our sunday trip around the inside politics table 1 watch the volume as omalley uses youtube to test clinton pokes  slowly but clearly former maryland gov martin omalley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton how aggressive will he get stay tuned  literally cnns jeff zeleny says omalley enjoys using youtube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion  and question moves by clinton like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain drivers licenses every time hillary clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from 08 to 16  her statement on the drivers licenses that we discussed and other things  martin omalley has been releasing a youtube video showing a speech where he has done something different so watch for that to continue said zeleny those youtube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race the liberals love them 2 the obama factor clinton finds a lot to love and some distance  hillary clinton is a big fan of president obamas health care law but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style so reports aps lisa lerer who was in iowa this past week for the clinton campaign rollout and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime obama 2008 rival who of course went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state she embraced key portions of his legacy  coming out strong for the health care law for his push for immigration legislation  but it wasnt all sunshine and light said lerer she also took subtle digs at his leadership style she said america was on the wrong track i cant believe im saying this but at times she sounded almost like a republican 3 in big policy choice clinton signals an important campaign focus  in democratic politics kamala is the harris sister who gets the most national buzz but maya harris is about to play a big role in the question of how hillary clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes kamala harris is the california attorney general and a 2016 senate candidate for the seat being vacated by democrat barbara boxer maya harris just signed on for a top policy role in the clinton campaign  and cnns niamalika henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message one clue i think is maya harris said henderson her resume is really a liberals dream  she has worked at the center for american progress aclu shes also done work on community policing and police reforming and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate so i think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that hillary clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color who are so crucial to getting the obama coalition back together again 4 walkerrubio rubiowalker a general contrast with some gop buzz  marco rubio drew a direct generational contrast with hillary clinton when he officially joined the gop 2106 race and wisconsin gov scott walker also often talks of his hope republicans will look for a nextgeneration leader as their next presidential nominee in political circles  meaning among junkies and strategists  there is constant debate about potential tickets  at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail but jonathan martin of the new york times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a walkerrubio pairing is not limited to inside the beltway chatter they both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that clinton and gore did  in 1992 said martin but whats interesting is in new hampshire over the weekend i was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates for the first time from an actual activist  not an operative but an activist  i heard somebody float the idea of a walkerrubio race in 2016 5 iowa new hampshire south carolina and then heading into the 2016 cycle the republican national committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less frontloaded now some big gop establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe  especially texas sen ted cruz iowa new hampshire and south carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar florida is usually the next big contest but it could be eclipsed by  sports fans will get this  what is becoming known as the sec primary it is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress but what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a super tuesday  or maybe backtoback tuesdays  in early march that include a number of conservative southern states alabama arkansas tennessee texas georgia maybe louisiana the shift is one reason former arkansas gov mike huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008 ditto for rick santorum they did well in the south but it didnt matter much because john mccain and mitt romney respectively were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted again there might yet be more changes but more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites  people like jeb bush or marco rubio  and helping those with strong evangelical connections  like huckabee and cruz",

        "article": "cnn easter is unique on the christian calendar a major point in the cycle of the religious year and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds christmas thats in part because easter is genuinely about how religious impulses and patterns can operate in ways that affect our lives nevertheless im often surprised by how little people even those supposedly within the christian tradition actually know about what is called holy week and its culmination on easter sunday   at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics and tolerance that have profound religious implications its worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday  and the awareness of the human condition in all its sadness and glory that it engenders after all holy week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent  still the fuss must puzzle those looking on wondering what it all means  why do christians make so much of this springtime week and make so much of easter weekend there is a phrase that many never come across even among christians  easter triduum  this refers to the three days of easter that begin with good friday proceed through holy saturday and conclude with easter sunday  its definitely a progression although the word itself  triduum  can refer to any three days of prayer easter triduum has a kind of major prologue in maundy thursday the day when by tradition jesus celebrated the last supper with his disciples in the upper room in jerusalem on the night before he was crucified  the idea of holy communion begins with this meal which was a passover meal jesus of course was jewish as were all his disciples  he was never trying to erase judaism and found a new religion  his work involved modifying and extending judaism in fresh ways on maundy thursday christians sometimes practice the washing of feet recalling that jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the last supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility  showing that he was himself a servant  and modeling a kind of ideal behavior good friday isnt in fact so good  its the day of the crucifixion when jesus was scourged and beaten forced to carry his cross to golgotha the place of the skull and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death  the actual scene of the crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel as do his last words assembled into the socalled seven last words of jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels some of these words are quotations as when jesus asked god why he has abandoned him  this is a quote from the 22nd psalm which opens  my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  good friday is a day of death sacrifice displacement fear holy saturday is probably the least understood day of the easter triduum  its a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of easter  this day occupies an anxious space in human experience when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isnt quite erased  cant be erased  simply by hope  its a day of depression a day of suspension then comes easter with the aura of the resurrection  im always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment when the body of christ becomes what is called a glorified body  this was not as ive said elsewhere the great resuscitation although thats part of it too  resurrection implies a total transformation something beyond the physical realm its very important that almost nobody who encounters jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him know him or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified  easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection with its promise of transformation  a shift from one form to another and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding the three days of easter the triduum occur only once a year on the calendar  but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again  we find ourselves emptied out in small ways nailed to our own trees in life embarrassed or broken by life it was the buddha who famously observed that life is suffering  good friday embodies the christian version of that truth  jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer  we must all die perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly  our friends and families must die  we all experience illness loss sadness a loss of confidence darkness  this is simply part of the human experience we dive again and again into holy saturday too  a period of transition when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view  we know well this inbetween time its an anxious passage with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope and weve all been resurrected again and again perhaps in tiny ways  this is the joy of easter and its not something reserved for one day on the calendar  its there whenever we experience what ts eliot once called the timeless moment which can only occur  paradoxically  in time itself  its a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time i suspect we all experience the triduum frequently sometimes more than once in a single day  but the ritual enactment of these three days of the easter season reminds all of those who practice christianity  and perhaps those who dont  that we should expect to move through darkness into light its a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression   its good cause for celebration too  and one that wont easily be coopted by secular culture",

but then a lot of people have been looking for charlie hill for a long time for 43 years cuba has provided refuge for hill from facing charges that he killed a new mexico police officer and hijacked an airliner to havana hill now 65 decided to give cnn an interview after wed spent two years trying to reach him he wants to discuss how for the first time he is considering leaving his safe haven and returning to the united states before talking more hill finishes his plastic glass of beer and takes a final draw on his stub of a cigarette we step out into the sunlight and go to a park where hill starts to give his reasons why he may soon end his long run from the law i miss my country he said his voice cracking i miss my family i would like to go back and see where my grandparents were born where i was born where i went to junior high eat some blackberry pie even go to mcdonalds thats only natural hill was a black power militant and said he is still a revolutionary but he craves the kind of french fries that only capitalism can make after five decades of cold warera mistrust the united states and cuba are working to reestablish full diplomatic ties but cases like hills present an obstacle to an improved relationship new mexico where hills case has been open for decades followed up on the shift in policy from the obama administration with gov susana martinez asking washington to pursue hills extradition critics of the new opening to cuba say havanas harboring of fugitives like charlie hill is enough of a reason to maintain a hard line against the government of raul castro and keep cuba on the state department list of countries that support terrorism state dept recommends removing cuba from terrorism list  hill now 65 may extradite himself first saying the warming of relations between the united states and cuba could mean an end to what he calls his exile on the communistrun caribbean island even if his return brings jail time new mexico police chief pete kassetas said he welcomed the news of hills possible surrender i understand that the social environment was very different in 1971 than it is today i encourage him to return to face the charges against him on the state level and on the federal level and end his selfimposed exile in cuba charlie hills  journey began on november 8 1971 when he and two other men  michael finney and ralph goodwin   were pulled over on i40 outside albuquerque new mexico in the middle of a crosscountry drive all three men were members of the republic of new afrika a black power militant group that sought to break off louisiana mississippi alabama georgia and south carolina into a separate nation for africanamericans they were on the way from california to the south with a car loaded with weapons to support the cause new mexico state police officer robert rosenbloom pulled over their rented ford galaxie sedan on suspicion that the car was stolen said kassetas at 1041 pm rosenbloom called in the california license plate of the militants car according to the new mexico law enforcement memorial fourteen minutes later the dispatcher radioed rosenbloom back but was unable to reach him a police officer arriving at the scene found rosenblooms body lying face down on the road kassetas said there was a single bullet wound to his throat rosenbloom gripped his flashlight with one hand and his gun with the other according to the records of the new mexico law enforcement memorial the sedan was found the next day abandoned with three military rifles a 12gauge shotgun revolutionary literature bombmaking materials and hundreds of rounds of ammunition  hill copped to riding in the sedan that rosenbloom pulled over but refused to say who shot the policeman i am not a cop killer i am a freedom fighter hill said i am a vietnam vet and people never ask me if i killed vietnamese because that was authorized by the american government i dedicated myself to liberating my people for 19 days hill said the men hid out in the new mexico desert working on an escape plan as 250 law enforcement officers closed in we had to go into exile so we hijacked a plane hill said the three men kassetas said commandeered a tow truck at gunpoint crashed through a fence onto the runway of albuquerque international airport and ran up the gangway to twa flight 106 elizabeth walthall was a flight attendant aboard the boeing 727 when the fugitives stormed aboard they were dirty and stunk from hiding out in the hills she told cnn from her home in north carolina walthall now 72 said charlie hill put a blade to her throat he told me to do what he said because this is no butter knife i told him well i am no piece of bread hill laughed she said and lowered the knife hijacker michael finney glowered and pointed a pistol at the flight attendants walthall said a tremor of fear audible in her voice as if the hijacking had just happened finney said he would shoot us and that he had already killed a man walthall said the hijackers ordered the crew to fly to africa informed the plane couldnt fly that far they changed their destination take us to cuba they told the pilot the trio knew cuba would most likely let them stay after seizing power in 1959 fidel castro blasted washington for failing to send back the batista regime officials who streamed to miami to escape castros revolutionary tribunals effectively ending the extradition agreement between the two countries a rash of airplane hijackings to the island soon followed cuba became popular with leftist revolutionaries as well as common criminals seeking a country beyond the reach of us law enforcement if anything went down you went to cuba hill said en route to havana flight attendant walthall said she served the men bottles of michelob beer when they finished she saved the bottles in airsickness bags so us law enforcement later would have their fingerprints after landing walthall said she last saw charlie hill and the other hijackers as cuban soldiers escorted them off the plane years later the flight attendant said she experienced flashbacks of the hijacking and sometimes prayed for hill i think he is a lost soul she said revolutionary cuba soon disappointed hill  cuban officials denied his request for military training to fight with revolutionary groups in africa instead he was put to work cutting sugar cane doing construction and administrating a clothing store one of the many menial jobs he worked he said put him under the supervision of ram\u00f3n castro fidel castros older brother he has a big beard and looks just like fidel hill remembered he was good to us made sure we were always well fed in 1996 thennew mexico rep bill richardson traveled to cuba to discuss hills extradition with fidel castro i talked to fidel and he said no way under no circumstances would he turn them over that they were legitimate fugitives richardson told cnn i got a very strong signal not only would i not be allowed to bring back charlie hill but i wouldnt even be allowed to talk to him hill is now the last living member of the trio of hijackers us officials said that ralph goodwin drowned in 1973 and michael finney succumbed to throat cancer in 2005 married and divorced twice in cuba hill has two children on the island and he worries about leaving them if he were to return to the united states but hill said he wants to visit his daughter who was 6 years old when he left and who he hasnt seen since he dreams of meeting the five grandchildren he has in united states hes gone as far as hiring a new mexico attorney in case he decides to negotiate a surrender his cuban government pension is a meager 10 a month he said not nearly enough to support him or even buy toys for his 8yearold cuban son hill said he became a babalao or santeria priest but still hasnt found peace he admitted he smokes too many unfiltered cuban cigarettes and drinks too much cheap rum and theres always the possibility that the cuban government has held onto hill and other us fugitives simply waiting for the right moment to trade them to the united states he said he is fine with that fate they took me in he said if the cuban government feels me going is for the benefit of 12 million people thats my sacrifice i dont worry about that as the interview ends hill lights another cigarette a group of americans touring havana in a 1950s classic car pull up to the park they have no idea they are feet away from a wanted fugitive but as hill would say thats cuba hill isnt interested in staying in touch he doesnt have a cell phone too poor he says he wont say exactly where he lives in havana he has to be cautious and as he walks off once again he is gone a side of cuba not often seen ",

running for safety she told agence francepresse awaking to terror i am lucky to be alive there are those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing i am lucky to be alive because i jumped through the fence with other students she said students ran  some crawled  away from the gunfire okari said at one point the gunmen pinned down a building where 360 students lived interior minister joseph nkaissery said okari took cover outside the campus and listened to explosions and gunfire for four hours kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen somali

million kenyan shillings about 215000 for mohamed mohamud who goes by the aliases dulyadin and gamadhere the post does not say what role the man may have played kenyan police are circulating wanted dead or alive posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in kenya the interior ministry said police are offering a bounty of more than 210000 for the suspects the

        "article": "cnn sundays announcement that corinthian colleges inc would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold forprofit colleges accountable corinthian which once enrolled more than 70000 students is one of the worst of the predator colleges  schools that offer dubious degrees saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year many of these schools are forprofit career colleges that operate mostly online its no wonder that corinthian is doing this after the us department of education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer there are about 13 million students enrolled in forprofit colleges many of which have questionable track records and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools with uncle sams student loan debt sheet topping 1 trillion we literally cant afford to continue funding forprofit colleges  which reportedly get 86 of their funding from federal student loan money for those not familiar with the forprofit college fiasco heres the whole story in one telling statistic while forprofit colleges enroll only 13 of the nations college students such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults according to department of education statistics for comparisons sake the default rate of forprofit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis how do these colleges operate its deviously simple convince lowincome students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans keep costs low through online classes and parttime professors and watch the money roll in the aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day according to a propublica investigation i can personally attest to the aggressive tactics my phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a forprofit college recently and i received so many calls per day that i had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number stopping the exploitation of students isnt easy the forprofit college business is a multibilliondollar industry the ceos of these companies make millions of dollars a year employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties but the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis hundreds of graduates of the nowdefunct corinthian joined a debt strike publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans in response education department secretary arne duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects now that corinthian is finally shutting down we must finish the job the remaining forprofit colleges should be closed any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim and their debts should be forgiven yes victim is the right word if these degrees actually helped people get jobs we should be celebrating them but according to a jawdropping report by the education department the average graduate of an online forprofit college makes less than a high school dropout not the equivalent of a high school dropout less than a high school dropout the reallife misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about one corinthian graduate has 37000 in debt for his computer science degree but he cant even get a job at best buy according to slate another graduate 33000 in debt has a medical assisting degree but she gave up on finding employment in her field she waits tables now the chronicle of higher education says i can already hear your next question if forprofit colleges are this terrible are they at least cheaper no in fact their cost is reportedly around 60 higher than a comparable degree from a public college whats even more frustrating is that weve known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years a 2011 report by the government accountability office found widespread rule breaking by the largest forprofit colleges  everything from accepting fictitious highschool diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating in one example an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor its not hard to get a 100 on the second try just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again according to the new york times in 2013 career education corp paid 10 million to settle charges by the state of new york regarding phony jobplacement claims all told no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating forprofit colleges in 2014 after selling off 95 of its campuses last year corinthian said on sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses blaming the failure on federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions on potential buyers you cant hide your bad behavior forever and the questionable practices of many forprofit colleges are starting to catch up with them enrollment at the university of phoenix  the largest forprofit college in the united states  has fallen by half to about 213000 we laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis and its time to do the same thing with forprofit colleges to keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree  still the best pathway to a middleclass life  we need to act now forprofit colleges have flunked their final exam now its up to their rich benefactor uncle sam to make sure they dont go back to school in the fall editors note an earlier version of this article said the san diego campus of the university of phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year that issue has been resolved",

        "article": "cnn late one night on facebook a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis and both their lives were changed forever the girl katie donovan read that the boy dalton prager was very sick  if you ever need a friend to talk to you can reach out to me she wrote sorry but do i know you he responded no you dont katie wrote back and told dalton a bit about herself like him she was 18 and my breathing is pretty crappy and i see you are in the hospital im sorry i know it sucksbut you just gotta stay strong messages between the two flew back and forth they realized they were falling in love for most other couples the next step would be to meet in person but for katie and dalton that was complicated  and dangerous cystic fibrosis patients shouldnt be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs dr michael anstead at the university of kentucky katies pulmonologist since she was a little girl had lectured her many times that facetoface meetings with other cf patients were a bad idea in their online conversations one of the first things dalton told katie about himself was that he had burkholderia cepacia a horribly dangerous infection for people with cf i was like hi im dalton from missouri and i have burkholderia cepacia because its such a big deal in the cf community he remembers i left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her katie listened to her heart even if it might hurt her lungs she asked dalton to come visit her in flemingsburg kentucky i told dalton id rather be happy  like really really happy  for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years katie says that was definitely something i had to think about but when you have those feelings you just know so on august 28 2009 dalton drove more than six hours from st charles missouri to katies hometown in flemingsburg kentucky where theyd arranged to meet at the dairy queen at 710 pm  they remember the time precisely  katie got out of her car and saw dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses my heart was racing but i just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello she remembers im usually not that kind of girl but it just felt so right katie took dalton and his mother renee whod made the trip with him to have dinner with her and her parents debbie and john donovan later the young couple drove around flemingsburg and dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday which was two days before their health quickly deteriorated and within months the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time too ill to work dalton quit his job at his familys auto repair shop and katie quit hers as a store clerk in august 2014 the couple entered the university of pittsburgh medical center together to wait for new lungs daltons came first and on november 17 he had his transplant despite his burkholderia cepacia which makes transplants more complicated it was a success i was so thrilled i was so happy for him katie says the month after daltons surgery upmc discharged katie  she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while when she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital but  upmc informed her shed used up her supply of medicare days and wouldnt accept her medicare  the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities  wouldnt pay for another hospitalization until katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days but katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days much less sixty so katie relied on medicaid public insurance that was supplied by her home state of kentucky she was admitted to the university of kentucky hospital where she was cared for by anstead her beloved pulmonologist but then another hurdle anstead explained that most lung transplant centers including the two in kentucky dont do transplants on patients with burkholderia cepacia referring them to larger centers like upmc that have more experience with such complicated cases katie and dalton now 24 and 23 were desperate her doctors predicted she wouldnt live a year without new lungs going on her husbands private insurance wasnt an option since dalton is on his fathers policy in february anstead wrote a letter to medicaid pleading with them to make an exception and pay for katies care at upmc even though it was out of state kentucky medicaid denied his plea and thats when the squabbling began in a statement to cnn a spokeswoman for the kentucky cabinet for health and family services pointed the finger at upmc saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a kentucky medicaid provider medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for outofstate providers in such situations wrote the spokeswoman gwenda bond should upmc reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a kentucky medicaid provider the department for medicaid serviceswill be happy to expedite their application upmc counters that kentucky medicaid told them that if they want to care for katie they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept kentucky medicaid patients while upmc spokeswoman wendy zellner didnt elaborate a hospital might be loathe to sign up for largescale coverage of outofstate medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take kentucky medicaid is an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to singlecase agreements that we have signed with other state medicaid programs zellner wrote upmc wants to help katie and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happenit is up to kentucky medicaid to address this situation today katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed hoping that the three parties  medicare medicaid and upmc  will work things out so she can get her new lungs i feel like theyre putting a dollar sign on my life she says i dont want to die because of money thats stupid nobody should have to do that if katie doesnt get her transplant not only will she die but shell never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection which could be deadly for him as hes on drugs to suppress his immune system as a result of inquiries from cnn on wednesday aaron albright the director of the media relations group at the centers for medicare and medicaid services arranged for a caseworker to call katie at the hospital but it didnt go very well katie says the caller who identified herself as pat pierorazio was rude mean and angry she said someone had told her to call me and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me she says katie says the medicare representative told her she would look into her situation in a statement albright with cms wrote to cnn we are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs cms is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance katie tries to stay strong just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first facebook conversation skyping with dalton helps and raising money on their facebook page keeps her mind busy and shes always thinking about their after transplant bucket list which they keep in a safe in their house so it wont be destroyed by fire or flood on the list drive through every state learn another language and visit a country where they speak it write a book together about their love story they have simpler dreams as well like going grocery shopping together or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television and this is their biggest goal  i just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in july and be able to hold hands and just hug thats all i really want  to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary she says wednesday afternoon there were signs of hope zeller the upmc spokeswoman sent an email to cnn ky medicaid has reached out to us to talk so stay tuned she wrote katie and dalton were glad to hear it i dont care what i have to do to get her lungs dalton said i will just keep trying until theres nothing left to try",

small and unusual living space is all that this employed single mother can afford in her highcost community in san mateo california nicole isnt alone in her struggles cnn recently published a powerful piece called poor kids of silicon valley that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the bay area  one aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people including 11 children  another chronicles a husband and wife named rich and stacey both of whom have jobs who are living in a san jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they dont have the money to go anywhere else although silicon valley has unique characteristics it isnt the only community confronting these challenges  our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis  the agency i lead the us department of housing and urban development recently released a report estimating that 77 million lowincome households live in substandard housing spend more than half their incomes on rent or both these are families who are dedicating 1 out of every 2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head  and the more they spend on housing the less they have to invest in their childrens education build up savings and shop at local businesses  these are outcomes that hurt our nations economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action hud is working with local partners across the country to do just that first were focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists since the mid1970s we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700000 affordable units  but by 2020 were in danger of losing more than 125000 because these mortgages are maturing ending agreements to control rents in these units  so weve launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come were also doing the same with public housing right now the nation is losing 10000 units of public housing every year mainly because of disrepair hud created the rental assistance demonstration  initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good its cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as lexington north carolina where the local housing authority is making 58 years worth of repairs in just 22 months including new lighting modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs rad has allowed local communities to raise more than 733 million in new capital to date thats why were asking congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program no american should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home in addition to preservation hud is also working to create new affordable housing  a harvard study revealed that in 2012 there were 115 million extremely lowincome households and only 33 million affordable units available  its clear that we cant preserve our way out of this problem  weve got to grow the supply to meet demand so hud is taking a multifaceted approach for example our home investment partnerships program is leveraging 4 in private and other public resources for every 1 in home funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families this is more than just a statistic it is progress for people from the families living in the broadway crossing development in washington to the seniors living in the woodcrest retirement residence in pennsylvania  to keep this momentum going weve asked congress to increase home funding by 16 to keep building affordable homes prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation we are also asking congress to expand our housing choice voucher program which allows recipients of modest means the elderly and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market  this includes restoring 67000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration and were targeting our resources where they can have a big impact for instance hud awarded 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the san francisco bay area including silicon valley in january  and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment to empower communities president barack obama has also requested 300 million for new local housing policy grants to help them increase housing affordability economic growth and access to jobs all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coasttocoast our nations affordable housing challenges wont be solved overnight and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper lets not squander this chance to make real progress for american families incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all",

        "article": "cnn whether a patient is in the hospital for an organ transplant an appendectomy or to have a baby one complaint is common the gown you know the one it might as well have been stitched together with paper towels and duct tape and it usually leaves the wearers behind hanging out youre at the hospital because somethings wrong with you   youre vulnerable  then you get to wear the most vulnerable garment ever invented to make the whole experience that much worse said ted streuli who lives in edmond okla and has had to wear hospital gowns on multiple occasions put another way they are horrible they are demeaning they are belittling they are disempowering said camilla mcrory of olney md hospital gowns have gotten a facelift after some help from fashion designers like these from patient style and the henry ford innovation institute the gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital but if efforts by some health systems are an indicator the design may be on its way out of style the cleveland clinic was an early trendsetter in 2010 it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the ceo who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon that feedback led to a search for something new said adrienne boissy chief experience officer at the hospital system the prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon diane von furstenberg settling on a reversible gown with a front and back vneck complete derriere coverage and features such as pockets softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern patients loved the gowns boissy said people felt much more comfortable in the new design not just physically but emotionally in recent years she added hospitals are looking at everything they do and trying to evaluate whether or not it contributes to enhancing the patient experience its all part of a trend among hospitals to improve the patient reviews and their own bottom lines  fueled in part by the health laws focus on quality of care and other federal initiatives the centers for medicare  medicaid services increasingly factors patients satisfaction into its quality measures which are linked to the size of medicare payments hospitals get sometimes the efforts involve large capital improvement projects but they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable improving the quality of food served to patients or as in this case updating hospital gowns ultimately this focus leads to a better patient experience said john combes senior vice president of the american hospital association the detroitbased henry ford health system is in the process of updating its gowns an initiative that began when the systems innovation institute challenged students at the citys college for creative studies to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem the students responded with the suggestion to redo the garment that has often been described by patients as flimsy humiliating indecent and itchy the process took three years but last fall the institute unveiled a new and improved version its made of warmer fabric  a cotton blend  that wraps around a patients body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue the hospitals signature colors patient expectations are part of the calculus they are demanding more privacy and more dignity said michael forbes a product designer at the henry ford innovation institute when the institute tested his gown design forbes said patientsatisfaction scores noticeably increased in a few days the new gown was emblematicof an attitude that was conveyed to me at the hospital  that they cared about me as a whole human being not just the part they were operating on said dale milford who received a liver transplant during the time the redesign was being tested that was the subtext of that whole thing was that they were caring about me as a person and what it meant for me to be comfortable but replacing the traditional design is no easy task what patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams meaning it must open and close easily the gowns also need to be easily massmanufactured as well as efficiently laundered and reused new designs though can be expensive after valley hospital of ridgewood nj switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage costs went up 70000 per year said leonard guglielmo the facilitys chief supply chain officer because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain beyond cost more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear said todd lee an assistant professor of medicine at mcgill university who coauthored a 2014 study in the journal jama internal medicine examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospitalprovided pants instead of or along with gowns often doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay but patients said they were never given those options traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly and several doctors lee spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the openbacked gown during their stay but the most common challenge isnt necessarily doctor expectations or costs its navigating hospital bureaucracies said dusty eber president of the californiabased company patientstyle which designs and sells alternative gowns in his companys experience hospital decisions are often made by committees not individuals theres a lot of bureaucratic runaround eber said kaiser health news khn is a nonprofit national health policy news service",

        "article": "cnn this is a difficult but necessary thing to say incidents of policeinvolved killings and assaults on unarmed africanamericans are unlikely to end soon thats partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a moment and its also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it this is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis the peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis  as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over the violent response of police officers to unarmed africanamericans is a decadeslong phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as race card politics and black grievance but this years spate of killings and assaults from ferguson missouri to north charleston south carolina to most recently baltimore are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the  africanamerican community so what makes now different the advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally as a result it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed africanamericans as has happened in the past to call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed africanamericans a national crisis is not an exaggeration  we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it a true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions the loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system how do we face this crisis first we must recognize that there are no quick fixes the culture of policing in cities such as new york and baltimore has developed over decades policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house to subvert that culture will require vigorous targeted and consistent training that training must include a focus on managing implicit bias encounters with the mentally ill and how best to deescalate encounters with members of the community especially young people training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles president barack obama is right when he reminds us that policing like education is a function of state and local government and its true that his options are limited and yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities how by conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards in contrast while the department of justice provides more than 1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training data collection or other measures with an explicit antiracial bias focus that must change also the civil rights division of the justice department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination such investigations doubled to more than 20 under attorney general eric holder but given the nearly 30000 police departments spread across the country this is woefully inadequate its been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination the results in places such as seattle and cincinnati where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices are promising but the 12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance much has been made of rogue police officers bad apples and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system they undoubtedly exist but the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline punish and where appropriate remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch there must be zero tolerance for racism brutality and corruption in police departments making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality ultimately the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally including who we decide to recruit to serve former baltimore police commissioner leonard hamm for example has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives that thinking reflects a spirit of adventure he told me rather than a spirit of service hamm is right  policing is at its core a service profession those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness courage and smarts but also integrity maturity empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve a national crisis requires a national response and that means that federal state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality until we see that kind of wholesale engagement the lives of innocent people  and the integrity of our legal system  hangs in the balance",

        "article": "cnn us president barack obamas recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the middle east is far from reassuring to the region in his interview with tom friedman from the new york times on april 4 obama explained us foreign policy moves on iran and cuba which friedman described as the obama doctrine  he stated that we will engage but we preserve all our capabilities by capabilities the president must mean the tools whether diplomatic economic or military to protect and defend us interests the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the us policy under the rest of obamas presidency instead of the new beginning that the president outlined in his much discussed cairo speech in 2009 us policy in the middle east remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground for example the president asserted in the interview that the uss core interests in the region are not oil are not territorial  our core interests are that everybody is living in peace that it is orderly that our allies are not being attacked that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them that massive displacements arent taking place yet at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment us allies such as the arab gulf states jordan lebanon and the legitimate government in yemen found themselves under serious threat and attack the syrian regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens and the middle east was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history implementing the core us interests outlined by obama in the interview is clearly not working there exist grave doubts about whether the current us administration is indeed ready to deploy the abovementioned capabilities it seems that the us will only use them when its national security is at stake and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president the use of drone technology across the region the military strikes being conducted against isis in iraq and syria and the framework agreement between iran and six world powers on the iranian nuclear programs are cases in point establishing a region living in peace is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the socalled obama doctrine in the same vein the majority of the arab world and the entire gulf region look at the recently announced iran nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation having directly experienced the problematic interventionist iranian policies for decades the arab world is simply not ready to give tehran the benefit of doubt on any regional issue but neither is it ready to trust us assurances that outside a nuclear agreement the us will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain iranian influence throughout the region or to defend the gulf cooperation council gcc states against any iranian threat instead the fear is that as long as iran abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year the us will negate downplay or simply ignore those iranian actions that the arab world considers as direct threats here actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from washington at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the arab world when he referred to our sunni arab allies the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying populations that in some cases are alienated youth that are underemployed an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic and in some cases just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances what obama failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to iran in his interview he never questioned irans appalling record on human rights treatment of the political opposition and minorities rights among other disturbing issues moreover the reference to saudi arabia being one of the sunni arab allies ignores the fact that there are nonsunnis living in the arab gulf and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the nonsunni arabs equally the assertion that the biggest threats that they the arab states face may not be coming from iran invading its going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries  is another example of the detachment from reality based on a gulf research center study when there are 48 militia groups supported by iran operating in iraq and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country it is simply naive to suggest there is no iranian threat the bottom line here is that us and arab national security interests are no longer on the same page ever since the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the arab world is tired of false promises the ongoing operation of ten mostly arab coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of yemen is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of arab countries to take matters in their own hands the gcc states may accept the invitation by the us president to come to camp david his maryland country retreat and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them the truth of the matter is that the region is not working and that misguided us leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region unfortunately the obama doctrine does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse",

        "article": "cedar falls iowa cnn as aides politely tried to rush ted cruz from an event in cedar falls to one in cedar rapids iowa on thursday the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him finally after the selfies and conversations started to die down his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall burly man stopped him senator he said can i pray with you real quick yeah cruz said as he clasped the mans upper arm and the two bowed their heads it was one of the many moments when cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week as the senator from texas hit the trail in iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate being the only official contender in the race cruz drew large crowds during his twoday swing across the state hes counting on iowa known for its vocal and active evangelical base to propel him forward in whats expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of gop candidates cruz himself displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room the senator regularly avoids using a podium instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone a scene reminiscent of a sunday morning sermon when he meets with people after events he embraces each ones hand with both of his softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye  a familiar interaction between churchgoing christians and their pastors the past two winners of iowas caucuses rose to victory with support from the christian right and cruz who announced his bid last month at the wellknown baptist school liberty university is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize evangelicals make up a large segment of iowas republican voter bloc according to a des moines registerbloomberg politics poll from january 44 of likely 2016 republican caucusgoers said they were bornagain or evangelical christians cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck gop leadership on fiscal issues but he showed in iowa last week that hes also eager to champion social issues at a time when many republicans are anxious to avoid them he was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in indiana which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians he described the outrage over the laws as shameful and an assault on first amendment rights there are a lot of people here in iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking watching what has happened in the last two weeks cruz said friday night at an event in des moines we have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty related republican 2016 hopefuls back indianas religious freedom law  hes more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a christian and a pastor rafael cruz whos become a celebrity among christian conservatives will frequently visit iowa over the next year cruz told voters and cruzs iowa director bryan english is a former pastor cruzs first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on fox news and nbc that are pegged to easter sunday in the ad cruz talks about the impact of the transformative love of jesus christ on his life while neither mike huckabee who won iowa in 2008 nor rick santorum who won in 2012 went on to win the nomination their successes helped launch them into highprofile battles with the thenfrontrunners and with both of them likely running again in 2016 the competition will be stiff thats why for cruz courting evangelicals is only a component of a threepronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base his stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction he received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the irs and in a knock against the national security agency he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so president obama can hear every word i have to say cruz argued thursday that the republican party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the ron paulrand paul faction of the party  young libertarianminded voters  and the santorum base  evangelicals the two blocs he said are not necessarily the best of chums if were going to win weve got to bring that coalition together he said in cedar falls and i think we can do that cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election a higher than normal turnout for the demographic that number has waned slightly since 2004  but its not too far off from the 56 of the overall population that voted in 2012 still his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals whove been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls if you look at available places for the party to expand the vote it doesnt exist in the middle it exists in the evangelical vote said rick tyler a top cruz adviser it isnt a pond its an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative russell moore president of the ethics  religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says moore points to hotbutton topics like religious freedom issues in the us as well as increased attention to the killing of minority christians in the middle east and rising antisemitism i dont think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith moore said i think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good later in april voters in iowa will see the bulk of the gop field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the iowa faith and freedom coalition while the past two winners of the iowa caucuses  santorum and huckabee  are likely running for president again steve scheffler president of the group argued that the field is wide open in terms of whos going to win favor among evangelicals jeb bush while not popular among conservative activists was known for his staunch antiabortion record as florida governor and touts his catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views scott walker is the son of a pastor ben carson the former neurosurgeon rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the obama administration at a national prayer breakfast and other likely candidates  from marco rubio to rick perry to rand paul  have made serious efforts to court the religious right its up for grabs its a clean slate regardless of if youve run before scheffler said naturally those two huckabee and santorum have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past but by and large voters are going to say let me take a good look at all of these candidates",

        "article": "cnn if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself the answer of course would be no yet for decades many have stood by the belief that such programs known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs promote and encourage drug use indeed for congress it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in 1988 that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs but an overwhelming body of scientific evidence continues to show that this is simply not true as a result of the recent spikes in hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural indiana and kentucky the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again and this time scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two bloodborne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes this is a welcome step  an estimated 50000 americans are newly infected with hiv every year and some 8 are among injection drug users meanwhile between 2006 and 2012 at least 30 states experienced increases in hepatitis c infection rates with more than half reporting at least a 200 increase in acute infections among young adults overall the prevalence of acute hepatitis c among people under 30 rose from 36 to 49 in six years with such numbers in mind the recent national spotlight on syringe services programs offers a critical opportunity for us to reignite a muchneeded conversation dozens of studies have demonstrated conclusively how effective syringe services programs have been in the fight against hiv and hepatitis c transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of dirty syringes  without increasing drug use in addition to helping curb the spread of these diseases by offering access to sterile syringes these programs promote public health and safety by taking syringes off the streets and protecting law enforcement personnel and others including children from injuries they also offer preventive health services such as hiv testing and counseling and form vital bridges to drug treatment overdose prevention housing and employment services for states such as new york and washington  early adopters of these interventions  syringe services programs have played a crucial role in driving down hiv transmission among injecting drug users washington was the first state in the united states to implement an syringe exchange when it opened a syringe services program in tacoma in 1988 in new york city  where half of all injection drug users were hiv positive in the 1980s  state lawmakers authorized syringe exchange in 1992 to combat the disease deeming it a public health necessity the expansion of these programs in new york was followed by a dramatic reduction in hiv incidence among injecting drug users declining from 54 in 1990 to 13 in 2001 hepatitis c prevalence declined from 90 to 63 during this period because they work syringe services programs will likely be an integral part of the statewide plans announced by new york gov andrew cuomo and washington gov jay inslee to reduce new hiv infections dramatically by 2020 syringe exchange programs not only save lives but also save millions of dollars in hiv treatment costs while a clean syringe costs less than 50 cents the average lifetime cost of treating an hivpositive person is estimated to be around 425000 as hivpositive injection drug users report higher levels of unemployment and homelessness public programs such as medicaid will ultimately become responsible for the expensive treatment costs for example an analysis by johns hopkins university researchers showed that expanding the availability of syringe services programs to cover just 10 of all injections in the united states would prevent almost 500 new hiv infections among drug users per year this translates into 193 million in savings reaped from averted treatment costs after an estimated 64 million investment in other words every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves between 3 and 7 in hiv treatment costs alone despite such evidence syringe services programs are continually caught in the political crossfire a longstanding ban temporarily lifted in 2009 and then reinstated by congress as part of 2010 budget negotiations prevents state and local jurisdictions from spending their federal health dollars on these programs lifting the ban will not cost any additional money  it simply allows states to spend their federally allocated dollars on syringe services programs if they choose to do so why is this important the federal government provides the majority of funding for all hiv prevention services without access to federal funding more than 200 syringe service programs in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico are operating on shoestring budgets from local and state governments this has forced syringe services programs across the country to cut staff scale down services and potentially shut their doors for good meanwhile the new hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in primarily rural states such as in indiana or kentucky show that the landscape of injection drug use in america is rapidly changing we have a chance right now to get ahead of the curve and avert a nationwide resurgence of hiv and hepatitis c infections through injection drug use it is time for congress to make sound and effective policy based upon facts rather than discredited assertions or unsubstantiated fears",

        "article": "cnn italians have a saying too much of something cripples it were overcrowded with so many frescoed churches medieval castles and roman ruins that we simply dont know what to do with them let alone care for a proper upkeep weve turned blind to their value and beauty there are nearly 5000 gems scattered across the country ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments italy boasts the highest number of unesco world heritage sites in the world  50 several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources and there are another 42000 that are at the mercy of mudslides floods and natural calamities the unescolisted basilica of assisi where st frances tomb lies is just the last of a series of national shames its frescoed walls by renaissance masters including giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle in a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500000 euros were talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world  not to mention its artistic value i remember once an american colleague asking me but what does italy do with its immense cultural heritage good question if other nations had half as much of what we boast theyd make a much better job with it paradoxically if we had just the coliseum or venice it would be easier but we dont and trouble is italy doesnt know how to exploit this treasure take the british museums successful exhibition on pompeii in 2013 we have the real site in our backyard but the british made the best of it worldwide while the real pompeii was  and still is  making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses or worse italy couldnt care less to promote its assets as a travel writer i have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and its a battle many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places i find myself almost begging them when it should be the other way round the true but sad thing is that restyling in italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors crowdfunding has already saved bolognas san luca portico the coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand todds while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts yet its not just a matter of scarce public resources or austeritydriven measures its also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment the care to cherish a countrys valuable monuments and thats because italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging italy despite its millenary history is one of the worlds most modern states unified in 1861 patriot massimo dazeglio once said now that weve made italy we need to make italians tough job indeed and were still a long way to go theres also widespread approach that tends to limit restyling in general heritage authorities are in love with the romantic ideal of decadent ruins better leave the monument or site as it is even allow it to rot rather than recover it and destroy its original beauty each time new subway works bring to light an unknown roman theatre or necropoli it all freezes  the public works and the artistic upkeep preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion but thats a blind approach theres so much italy could do with what it has that it could live off tourism  symbola foundation estimates that culture and art if well exploited could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year amounting to 153 of gdp another thorny issue is having a cheap culture entrance tickets to the coliseum italys top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists cost a maximum of 12 euros materas rock crypts are 5 euros not to mention churches featuring michelangelos works which are free to enter the first time i visited westminster abbey in london and st patricks church in dublin i was shocked to find out i had to pay to get in and it was quite expensive too one could argue that italy does well to open for free the lords doors but probably in some critical cases a minimum cost to enter wouldnt hurt the countrys mindset needs to change too monuments and works of art are not dead but living things that deserve to be sexedup once in a while if we dont have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance why not give them over to other countries to run or sell them to rich businessmen similar options make state authorities hair stand on end they stress art belongs to the italian people and should remain in public hands  even if its inaccessible and unenjoyable yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private thriving multimedia museum the uffizi galleries secret cellars are stacked with 2500 forgotten masterpieces which could be leased out to privates curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved but cobwebs and dust can do no harm right our sunny piazzas bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities coffers and who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo there are also 6000 abandoned medieval ghost towns that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy the state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out one being a renaissance villa in florence turned into a deluxe spa resort fine rome wasnt built in a day but it could crumble in an hour",

        "article": "cnn after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered on its website the ncaa prominently states its our commitment  and our responsibility  to give young people opportunities to learn play and succeed and later it says that in the collegiate model of sports the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first athletes second but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes the lawsuit claimed the students didnt get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history in its response the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to studentathletes at its member institutions even with pages of online information about academic standards and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of studentathletes and the ncaa does not have direct daytoday operational control  over member institutions like unc its nonsense its double talk said gerald gurney a former athleticacademic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport if you look at their basic core principles its all about academics the experience the integration of academics and the education of the student is paramount gurney said they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement which read in part  the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaas role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist studentathletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field this case is troubling for a number of reasons not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every studentathlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them said donald remy ncaa chief legal officer in its response to the lawsuit it also likened its role to that of the american bar association or american medical association and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately the scandal at unc involved thousands of athletes who over 18 years were funneled into classes that never met where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports mary willingham the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though theyre academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required the system of eligibility that the ncaa brags about she says is a sham why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we cant legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway it makes no sense said willingham who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called cheated if they cant legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that then why certify students semester after semester to play its lost its meaning for me the ncaas claim that its handsoff when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years not just in the rhetoric on its website but in speeches by its president mark emmert and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes for example before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed obannon suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism insisting that college athletes are paid with an education thats the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by bigtime sports attorney jeffrey kessler seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value in response the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education consistent with its commitment to amateurism member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws attorney michael hausfeld who represented both obannon and now the unc athletes said this  this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaas shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that what we live for is the education of our athletes but the ncaas record tells a far different story but rick burton professor of sport management at syracuse university said its not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country i understand i think where the ncaa is coming from we would not let the ncaa come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university he said it sounds like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina and theres no logic to that he said the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the ncaa unc which was also sued has admitted to the fraud but also asked for a judge to throw out the case saying the athletes waited too long  seven years  to sue and the educational malpractice theory doesnt apply unc claims it is protected by state law this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal the ncaa which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from dangerous and exploitive athletic practices now says it does not enforce health and safety rules in fact in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 the ncaa wrote the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect studentathletes a cnn investigation found that the ncaa has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions  far behind even the nfl ramogi huma president of the national college players association and a leading thorn in the ncaas side for decades said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all theres nothing left the ncaa can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society one has to wonder what does the ncaa do if it doesnt protect players if it doesnt play a role in the education of college athletics it begs the question of why does the ncaa exist  and why does it have a tax exemption",

primally horrifying method of execution british and american aid workers japanese and american journalists kurdish and syrian soldiers and egyptian and now ethiopian christians were among those who followed in foleys wake their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated as propaganda to a global online audience these highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group  and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the isis cause but beyond this some experts such as psychology professor arie w kruglanski suggest the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knockon effect he says the spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copycat acts or threats of decapitation  not only from islamists but from the disbelievers they target kruglanski distinguished professor of psychology at the university of maryland says the frequent high profile reports of isis beheadings could result in psychologically priming people to be more inclined to emulate them or threaten to during moments of conflict or extreme stress because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally the very concept of beheading that was virtually nonexistent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated is now there he told cnn it comes to mind when a conflict happens when you react aggressively he said it sits there in our unconscious and can be activated under certain circumstances when the passions run high and result in actual behavior reports of beheadings also emerge from saudi arabia where it is a legal method of execution under the countrys judicial code and mexico and brazil where it is typically the work of criminal gangs but neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as isiss propaganda in which the threat is extended to disbelievers around the globe a similar copycat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings said kruglanski once the idea is planted then when someone is upset feeling violent the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes more readily to mind because its sitting there in our unconscious he said a lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are being carried out by nonjihadists more often but reports of such cases have been frequently making the headlines in december and january two victims were decapitated  outside a florida home and in a shopping mall in chinas shaanxi province  in crimes with no apparent connection to terror in london alone a city deeply impacted by the murder and attempted decapitation of soldier lee rigby by islamic extremists in 2013 three women were reportedly beheaded last year in alleged crimes with no apparent jihadist motivation and in the united states an oklahoma man is awaiting trial accused of beheading a coworker in september whether he was inspired by isis propaganda remains unclear he was reportedly a recent convert to islam and had posted osama bin laden and beheading content online whether or not nonjihadist beheadings are on the increase this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness as isiss beheadings have grabbed international headlines and the terror groups call on supporters to attack disbelievers has reverberated worldwide in australia and the philippines jihadrelated threats or plots to decapitate have allegedly been made in the past seven months recently a muslim convert in london was found guilty of a plot to behead a british soldier inspired by the rigby murder the theme of beheading was also front and center in an incident in belgium in january where fans of football team standard liege unfurled a giant banner depicting the severed head of an opponent the club condemned their actions as totally unacceptable beyond this threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among nonjihadists said kruglanski in the us a michigan man was arrested in january for threatening to decapitate the new york police officer who put eric garner in a fatal choke hold which triggered widespread civil rights protests and months earlier in october police reportedly received a threat to behead elementary school students in rhode island roderic broadhurst a professor of crime policing security and justice at the australian national university said the isis beheadings may have shown those engaging in attentionseeking threats of violence a sure way to get noticed an awareness of what really shocks and gets news is clearly on show he said the threats and banner demonstrated the way in which the spread of beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically brutalizing effect on society said kruglanski intensifying the violence of our thoughts words and actions ultimately were talking about contributing to the brutalization of interpersonal and intergroup conflict all over the planet he said justin hastings a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the university of sydney said that while isis beheadings might inspire some people to prefer that particular way to kill people as opposed to others he believed it would eventually fall out of favor while beheading had been adopted by isis as their stock in trade it would inevitably lose its shock value driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue capturing international attention one such dramatic escalation occurred in february when isis released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading was abandoned altogether for fresh horrors  burning jordanian pilot moath alkasasbeh alive in a cage later that month isis released a video released showing what appeared to be kurdish peshmerga fighters paraded down iraqi streets in cages for many a baffling aspect to the executions has been how such overweening brutality could win support for the isis cause while the executions are viewed by the vast majority of people as repellent kruglanski said they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers by projecting a sense of godlike power we all have this morbid instinctual fascination with death and killing and torture which is sublimated and constrained by civilization and our culture and socialization he said most of us are peaceful even though these drives exist in our subconscious civilization rests on its ability to constrain them but when the death instinct  this drive to kill and promote violence  was legitimized by a powerful narrative such as a religious or ideological call to global jihad then that can result in unregulated atrocities he said for some foreign jihadists who had traveled to iraq and syria to fight for isis the realities of the socalled islamic state had driven them to return home disenchanted he said but others remained in each of us there is this battle of good versus evil said kruglanski its a battle in everybodys soul",

the sides are still talking whether your glass is halffull or halfempty it doesnt change the fact that its not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations nor does it change the fact that tuesdays selfimposed deadline didnt really matter anyway the date that really counts is june 30 when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal  with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out  or else everything falls apart the whole point of whats happening in lausanne switzerland is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement for those hoping that will eventually happen its good that iranian foreign minister javad zarif us secretary of state john kerry and senior european union diplomat helga schmid held talks early thursday morning in lausanne but it doesnt mean there will be a final deal we have made significant progress over the last few days but it has been slow going british foreign secretary philip hammond told reporters wednesday im optimistic that we will make further progress  but it does mean the iranians being willing to meet us where there are still issues to deal with fingers crossed and well hope to get there during the course of the day but by thursday morning there was still no deal zarif told reporters that iran has shown its readiness to engage with dignity and its time for our negotiating partners to seize the moment and use this opportunity which may not be repeated ive always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together they are mutually exclusive the iranian minister said so our friends need to decide whether they want to be with iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure they have tested the other one it is high time to test this one us state department official marie harf said on twitter that talks between kerry and zarif ran deep into the early hours of thursday morning that was truly an allnighter she tweeted around 6 am local time 12 am et saying the negotiations had broken up and would resume again in a few hours another us official had said earlier that some serious issues remain unresolved it is still totally unclear when this might happen if it happens at all theres one thing that most everyone does agree on the sides have made progress in recent days in fact zarif called it very good progress that led to solutions on most issues according to irna the staterun islamic republic news agency as long as the conversations continue to be productive white house press secretary josh earnest said us officials will keep on talking russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  whose country has been taking part in the talks along with germany france britain and the european union  went so far as to say with a large degree of confidence that framework agreements have been reached on all the key aspects of this issue at the ministerial level we hope that these agreements will be put on paper in the next few hours or a day at the most lavrov said before leaving the talks along with his counterparts from china and france the agreement stipulates a comprehensive approach to settling this issue including iaea verification of the exclusively peaceful nature of irans nuclear program and detailed provisions on lifting the sanctions but it doesnt matter if russia or germany is comfortable with the details the key is getting the united states and iran on the same page something thats hard given the decades of contempt and distrust  according to an irna report zarif said only that he hopes a framework agreement will be drafted wednesday i think its a matter of political will its not just about technical details anymore said fawaz gerges a professor of middle east studies at the london school of economics youre talking here about an institutionalized relationship of hostility between the united states and iran even then gerges on wednesday gave the sides a 60 to 70 chance of coming to some sort of preliminary agreement soon his reasoning i think there is a convergence of interests between obamas administration and the iranian leadership and thats why both camps have a vested interest in signing an agreement as opposed to walking away for iran which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes a deal would mean relief from punishing economic sanctions for the west it would offer hope of improved relations with tehran without the destabilizing threat of an iranian nuclear bomb in the pipeline the sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years thats why iran is facing crippling sanctions in the first place because many world powers felt they could not trust tehran given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks the tone changed with the 2013 election of iranian president hassan rouhani a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions and there has been some movement including in recent days out of iran still its too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything mohammad marandi a professor of north american studies at tehran university told cnn that iranian officials feel theyve already compromised a lot in the talks they feel that theyve gone as far as they possibly can and that its for the americans right now to make a move he said 21 questions on iranian nuclear talks  the main sticking points at the moment are believed to be the pace at which un sanctions on iran will be lifted how much nuclear research and development iran will be able to maintain and whether iran will ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for reprocessing into a safer form even if those points are resolved to the satisfaction of all sides any agreement is expected to come under attack on multiple fronts obama is likely to face a stern challenge selling any deal to congress while hardliners in iran will probably denounce it for being too harsh the leader of israel a key us ally that considers iran to be an existential threat on tuesday said the agreement that is being formed in lausanne is paving the road to that result and on wednesday israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu obliquely suggested that the united states could be threatened as well the middle east is plagued by antiwestern antidemocratic and antiamerican extremism  despots lead their people in chants of death to america while building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach america in this violent and unstable region where states are exploding said netanyahu referring to some iranian leaders and reports that iran could develop intercontinental missiles irans power rises with or without deal  obama administration officials say that any agreement would involve heavy monitoring of irans nuclear activities they insist no deal would be better than signing a bad deal but if no agreement is reached and the talks fall apart the potential consequences are deeply unsettling further sanctions on iran would most likely follow israel argues that could eventually force tehran back to the negotiating table to settle for a tougher deal but obama administration officials say they fear iran will redouble efforts to advance its nuclear program without any meaningful international inspections iranian progress toward a nuclear weapon could spark an arms race in the middle east and talk of military strikes from the united states or israel the military option will remain on the table us defense secretary ashton carter told nbcs today show on tuesday if there is a good agreement to have obviously its worth waiting for and completing the negotiations cnns elise labott reported

        "article": "cnn president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president reaching a good solid agreement with iran is a worthy desirable goal but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations weakening americas hand and strengthening iran obamas political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager even desperate side in these talks even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions the country whose only significant export oil lost more than half of its value in recent months the reason is that obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b few believe it particularly in the middle east and notably among americas arab friends who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it iran is having a great obama administration thats a belief that has already started shaking up the region saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped and there is little doubt that other countries among irans muslim rivals will do the same in fact the notion that obama is not handling the iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen where saudi arabia and other arabs are trying to push back against gains by irans allies we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in 2007 when thensen obama said he would meet irans leaders without preconditions leading his rival hillary clinton to call the idea irresponsible and frankly naive as the years of his presidency unfolded and the middle east started coming apart finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after obamas march 31 deadline the usimposed deadline served only to pressure the united states and the french ambassador very publicly decried as a bad tactic that bad tactic was a political move a push to produce some sort of result however vague to protect the talks from critics again a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development but the agreement so far does not look promising it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what obama had vowed in a presidential debate in 2012 obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations the deal well accept is they end their nuclear program its very straightforward nobody is talking about iran ending its nuclear program not even close iran will be allowed to keep onethird of its more than 6000 centrifuges thats not a small symbolic number and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled although fordow will contain no nuclear materials iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses the fact is that iran has a wellestablished record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to un inspectors and the un agency chief says that has not stopped a couple of weeks ago with days left until the negotiating deadline un nuclear chief yukiya amano said iran is still stonewalling we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is for a peaceful purpose he warned the negotiations starting point is that iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible  and preferably forever the world only learned about irans secret facilities at arak and natanz after dissidents raised the alarm iran we have learned repeatedly is very good at lying to international inspectors it is wellestablished that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program it is wellestablished that many of irans neighbors dont trust it and are anxious about the usled international dealings with iran it is wellestablished that iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table it was iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks but political considerations turned the united states into the supplicant the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon nuclear enrichment will continue although at a lower level iran officially legally becomes a nuclear threshold state with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a breakout period of one year the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act even the fordow facility conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain will remain in existence though converted to a nuclear research facility and without nuclear material on site international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place even if operating at a reduced pace giving iran much of what it wanted with iranian forces gaining ground in arab lands and iranian commanders declaring the destruction of israel nonnegotiable and threatening saudi arabia this deal does not look reassuring obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option but the deal so far looks like another win for iran it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the middle east",

as ly knew it was shattered when her hometown the cambodian capital of phnom penh fell to the genocidal khmer rouge regime of the communist party of kampuchea ly then 13 was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who along with virtually the entire population of phnom penh  about two million people  were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work ly never saw them again nor learned what happened to them but about 20000 people died from execution starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint according to war crimes prosecutors the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination where many met similar fates the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the khmer rouges revolutionary program of social engineering intended to establish a new order  free of money family ties religion education property and foreign influence aimed at creating an agrarian utopia it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era resulting in the deaths of at least 17 million cambodians  about a quarter of the countrys population  over the next four years ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979 his killing prompted ly to leave her sole remaining family member youngest sister bo in the care of a local couple she set out on her own making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the united states for more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister i think she was the only family member to survive she says with tears in her eyes as she finishes her story the producers usher a woman on the stage its bo ly embraces her sister and both women sob i missed you so much ly says ive always searched for you bo tells her since production began five years ago the television show its not a dream has reunited members of 54 cambodian families shattered by the genocide more than 1500 have sought its help the series is just one example of the ways in which cambodias traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught painful business of reckoning with their history the scars of the khmer rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern cambodia said theary seng a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime and who moved to the us as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult she described the country as a land of orphans for decades after the khmer rouge were driven from phnom penh by sovietbacked vietnamese forces in january 1979 the regimes crimes were seldom spoken about let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims in large part this was because people remained scared say experts far from being snuffed out by the vietnamese invasion the khmer rouge existed for another two decades after fleeing the capital in 1979 khmer rouge leader pol pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west they continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a governmentinexile that until 1990 was recognized by the un as the countrys only legitimate representative in many villages people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades said krisna uk executive director of the center for khmer studies craig etcheson a cambodia expert at the school for conflict analysis and resolution at george mason university said that for many years there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the khmer rouge as if the very words were  a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room the silence was also due to the fact that cambodians in sengs words lacked the vocabulary of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society the khmer rouges attempts to reboot society at year zero had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the countrys educated classes  doctors lawyers accountants engineers merchants and clergy nearly two generations of young cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill said etcheson when it was finally time to rebuild there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again even today said uk young cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school in an impoverished country  one of asias poorest albeit with 7 predicted economic growth this year  most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back she said some were even skeptical that the khmer rouges crimes  the systematic butchery of the killing fields  had really occurred she added the space for discussing redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the khmer rouge tribunal said seng founded in 2006 the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia eccc is a hybrid tribunal using both cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the khmer rouges crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice intended as a southeast asian equivalent of the nuremberg trials the tribunal which has cost 232 million so far initially enjoyed broad support we had great hope for this process said seng the presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the khmer rouge crimes but the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals two of whom have died while facing trial another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial the khmer rouges top leader pol pot died in 1998 having never faced charges this coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the cambodian government has soured attitudes towards the court seng who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings today regards it as a sham for many victims it is too little too late opinion an ongoing struggle for justice after the khmer rouge  in the first case heard kaing guek eav also known as comrade duch  commandant of the notorious tuol sleng prison where more than 14000 people were killed  received a life sentence for war crimes crimes against humanity murder and torture the courts only other verdicts delivered in august last year sentenced non chea the regimes brother number two and khieu samphan brother number four to life both men have appealed their convictions in a separate case the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016 eccc spokesman lars olsen said two further and highly controversial cases known as 003 and 004 are also currently under investigation three people were charged last month in relation to those cases former khmer rouge navy commander meas muth im chaem a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp and ao an a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers two other suspects are being investigated olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004 prime minister hun sen cambodias strongman leader for decades has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004 claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war hun sen himself is a former khmer rouge battalion commander who defected to the vietnamese side his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal others are more forgiving of the tribunals shortcomings etcheson a former investigator for the tribunal has described it as an imperfect vessel for delivering justice but says cambodias leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives delivering justice for victims and completing the reintegration of former khmer rouge into society he said the most important aspects of the tribunals work are those that take place outside the courtroom  triggering changes in cambodian society in that respect the proceedings  may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped he added undoubtedly cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide  to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece krisna uk said the country has seen a wave of khmer rouge memoirs written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die theres a lot of people who want to tell the world theyve been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad she said khieu samphan brother number four published one such effort ahead of his trial while sikoeun suong a sorbonneeducated former diplomat for the khmer rouge regime published his journey of a khmer rouge intellectual in french in 2013 he told an interviewer from frances le monde last year that he believed that khmer rouge dictator pol pots prescriptions for cambodia were sound i remain convinced that the marxist analysis made by pol pot of the socioeconomic situation of cambodia a poor and sparsely populated country was correct he said for survivors these selfserving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take but for a few of them at least cambodias opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing however bittersweet on the stage of the its not a dream studio as ly hugs her longlost sister footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen do you know the person in the video the shows host asks yes ly says she is my mother moments later te souymoy 77 is brought up on stage where have you two been te asks i always worried about you two i thought you died ly says the three women cry and embrace it is very miserable for all of us the old woman says",

life one day two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her they probably would have succeeded but after the first bullet was fired cifuentes two sons dragged her inside still in her deeply conservative community it took neighbors two hours to call for help and cifuentes lost her arm but the abuse didnt stop there when she returned home cifuentes husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left thats when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began cifuentes case is dramatic but in

36yearold civil war during the conflict atrocities were committed against women who were used as a weapon of war in 1996 a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions many remain in power and they have not changed the way they view women some 200000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decadeslong conflict most of them from indigenous mayan populations nearly 20 years later according to the security sector reform resource centre levels of violent crime are  higher in guatemala than they were during the war but despite the high homicide rate the united nations estimates 98 of cases never make it to court women are particularly vulnerable because of a deeprooted gender bias and culture of misogyny in many cases femicide  the killing of a woman simply because of her gender  is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war including rape torture and mutilation mexican drug cartels organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness  authorities investigating drugrelated killings are stretched thin leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides in many cases crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation many consider the guatamalen national civil police or pnc corrupt underresourced and ineffective even if a case does get prosecuted according to human rights watch the countrys weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in guatemala is the countrys deeply rooted patriarchal society according to mar\u00eda machicado ter\u00e1n the representative of un women in guatemala 80 of men believe that women need permission to leave the house and 70 of women surveyed agreed this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence rights groups say machismo not only condones violence it places the blame on the victim the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize politicians dont think women are important says former secretary general of the presidential secretariat for women elizabeth quiroa political parties use women for elections they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty many girls especially in indigenous communities dont go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far quiroa says they are subject to rape violence and forced participation in the drug trade although the situation for girls and women in guatemala is alarming there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing  with the help of an organization known as cicam or centro de investigaci\u00f3n cifuentes was finally able to escape her  husband and get the justice she deserved he is now spending 27 years behind bars cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art since 2008 she and four other abuse survivors known as la poderosas or the powerful have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly but it also offers suggestions for change and its having an impact women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support men are reacting too one of the main characters lesbia t\u00e9llez says  during one presentation a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated he said he wanted to be different the taboo topic of genderbased violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of guatemalas most vulnerable groups indigenous mayan girls  in 2004 with help from the united nations and other organizations the population council launched a communitybased club known as abriendo oportunidades or opening opportunities the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential senior program coordinator alejandra colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time they realize they are entitled to certain rights colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence the guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women in 2008 the congress passed a law against femicide two years later the attorney generals office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women in 2012 the government established a joint task force for crimes against women making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need the government has also established a special 24hour court to attend to femicide cases on the global front the international violence against women act was introduced in the us congress in 2007 it has been pending ever since but last week the act was reintroduced in both the house and senate if approved it would make reducing levels of genderbased violence a us foreign policy priority pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations which are on the front lines of the fight against genderbased discrimination in guatemala ben weingrod a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group care says we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence  our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women but the job is far from over while there is tempered optimism and hope for change the problem of genderbased violence in guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors which has allowed her to move forward but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures for them its a race against time and help cannot come soon enough",

particularly vocal about making his mark on history when india successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around mars last year modi reveled in the moment history has been created today he said we have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible the success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation soon after the galactic feat he took to the stage at new yorks famous madison square garden and received a welcome so rapturous that jon stewart called him americas first modi and all along modi has issued his call to make in india encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in india where there is a vast talent pool and lowcost production while modis india is out to put its economy on the fast track chinas economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth president xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending while cracking down hard on corruption and its been predicted that india could outpace china as the worlds fastest growing economy as soon as this year so is the worlds largest democracy primed to overtake the worlds biggest single party state as the next economic miracle opinion what india can learn from china  not so fast says china watcher and india today correspondent ananth krishnan china is still pulling away from india the beijingbased reporter said if india grows 75 this year and china grows 74 i think it makes a good headline  but i think people shouldnt get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between china and india chinas economy may be slowing down but india faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure in terms of education having access to different resources and job creation china has done well it has progressed far better compared to india said infosys china ceo rangarajan r vellamore even though there is free movement across the country in india the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education in a recent budget the modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth but despite modis big probusiness push india simply cant size up against chinas raw economic might after 30 years of dedicated efforts in building china into a manufacturing powerhouse it would take a long time for india to build that kind of manufacturing capability said haiyan wang managing partner of the china india institute its not just about lower labor costs you have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains you have to have the knowledge you have to have the skills you have to be connected to the international market she said so when you ask if india could compete with china i dont think that is going to be happening  not in the next 20 years the indian elephant may be charging ahead but the sinewy dragon has the muscle to stay ahead china has the capacity the connectivity and the capital to throw its weight around and being a single party state with no free elections xi can march toward a longterm goal without fretting about the next election but thats not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region even if china is putting money into the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and the silk road fund it is also building airstrips on reclaimed islands on the south china sea said krishnan there no question that indias rise is far less threatening than chinas rise with the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in india the impression of china as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries if you look at indias seven northeastern states which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure its inconceivable for any of those states to allow a chinese company to come and build roads said krishnan so when modi touches down in beijing next month for his second meeting with xi can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business as pragmatic as president xi is as pragmatic as prime minister modi is economic integration is going to happen regardless of 100 trust or not said haiyan wang eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance if these two countries come together 40 of the worlds people are going to be prosperous said vellamore if they are able to come together there can be a new kind of world order in the entire region which is going to benefit all of asia its a moment for both leaders to make a lasting mark on history",

headscarf with several shopping bags as she stood outside the barricaded entrance to one of istanbuls busiest subway stations she was one of millions of turks left confused and concerned by the worst power outage to grip the country in more than a decade dozens of cities across turkey lost power for hours on tuesday millions of people were affected including passengers stranded on paralyzed trains and subways municipal workers were forced to evacuate istanbuls marmaray tunnel where the blackout left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the bosphorus strait more than 24 hours later turkish officials were still at pains to explain the power outage the energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines the prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack the mysterious collapse of much of the countrys energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media some twitter users went so far as to suggest the blackouts were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in june there is fertile ground for rumormongering in turkey over the last five years security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals journalists prosecutors civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government the governments increasingly heavyhanded repression of public dissent combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet have also contributed to a hyperpolarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere even turkeys veteran deputy prime minister bulent arinc recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him with hatred rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002 meanwhile mysterious blackouts are a sore spot for some turks after a surreal 2014 incident on election night  allegedly involving a feline saboteur that is  a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer that was almost exactly a year ago a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging the ruling justice and development party ended up winning by a comfortable margin but few turks were reassured by the energy ministers explanation that the voting day blackouts were caused by a cat getting lost as electricity was just starting to come back on in istanbul on tuesday a second crisis erupted websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the dhkpc began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the palace of justice the monolithic court house in the center of istanbul there they took hostage mehmet selim kiraz the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country the gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at berkin elvan a 15yearold boy who was critically wounded during antigovernment protests that raged across istanbul in 2013 the boys death after months in a medicallyinduced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government on tuesday in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house the turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the palace of justice siege the broadcast ban is a measure that the turkish government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks the government also famously shut down twitter and youtube in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption ultimately tuesdays court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded turkish officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting online and in the streets some turks began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostagetaking inside one of turkeys bestprotected buildings even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected just hours after the shooting tensions exploded yet again at the court house istanbuls police chief had called for a press conference as journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse some bystanders began chanting government thieves just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the palace of justice police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government the reactions to tuesdays bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary turkey the country is tense and confused after years of backtoback political crises heavyhanded censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society and the absence of a common credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the arab spring in 2011 turkey was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the middle east  many of those arab countries have since descended into conflict repression and instability in the meantime turkey feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making",

men disillusioned and angry  could not be worse a group of fighters in afghanistan agreed to be filmed by a cnn cameraman parading their isis flags in a valley not far to the south of kabul the afghan capital they are the first images of their kind shot by western media inside afghanistan the rise of isis is an issue that the afghan president ashraf ghani has termed a terrible threat us officials cnn has spoken to have voiced their concern about the potential for an isis presence one us military officer said the militants currently have limited capability but are trying to recruit disillusioned taliban in several areas around the countrys east and south there has been some very small numbers of recruitment that has happened colonel j b vowell told cnn you have disaffected taliban who are losing politically and some of the younger newer fighters are moving to that camp it doesnt mean its operationally better we are concerned about it  resources weapons capabilities but i dont see an operational effect in the valley the men display their weapons and practice high kicks they are a little breathless at altitude a little clumsy they are all masked all in militarystyle uniforms our cameraman described how locals seemed to keep their distance from them it is often said that rivalry between the nascent isis presence and the taliban who remain the big guns in afghanistan is fierce enough to mean the isis fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag but it is fatigue with the taliban that appears to have provided fertile ground for their rise one of them told cnn we established contacts with is another acronym for the group through a friend who is in helmand in southern afghanistan he called us saying the is people have come to afghanistan  lets join them then we joined them and pledged allegiance to them our cameraman wasnt allowed to film the satellite phones they say they use to talk to iraq and syria they said they were religious students and deny any former association with the taliban they said that at night they go into nearby villages to try and find yet more recruits they watch a mixture of online propaganda old and new on their smartphones the fighter went on to explain that they were currently talking to the taliban to determine whether they would work with or rival them  he added they are currently designating a new leader after the supposed head of isis in afghanistan abdul rauf khadim was reportedly killed in a drone strike earlier in the year for months the afghan government played down the threat of a looming isis presence in afghanistan yet during his recent trip to washington ghani struck a different tone we are the front line the terrorists neither recognize boundaries nor require passports to spread their message of hate and discord from the west daesh is already sending advance guards to southern and western afghanistan to push our vulnerabilities he told us congress in late march using the pejorative name used to describe the militants by many isis opponents in the region there is some evidence to suggest that isis may already be operating in the country a series of brutal attacks on civilian buses have baffled investigators in the past month the first was in february when 30 people from the hazara ethnic group  shia muslims  were abducted from a bus near zabul province in the south of the country they have yet to return another hit three buses traveling in wardak central afghanistan killing 13 civilians including women and children suspicions have fallen on possible nascent isis cells as the taliban have vehemently denied responsibility for the attacks khalil andrabi the police chief of wardak told cnn of the bus attack i cant hundred percent say that they were is but their act was completely similar to what is is doing in syria and iraq solid info on isis whereabouts in the country is hard to come by cnn spoke to local officials from five regions  some emphasized the growing threat of the terror group while others played it down zabul mp abdul qader qalatwal says people have seen foreigners from central asian countries and arab countries wearing black clothes and masks and having black flags in the districts of khak afghan and in parts of arghandab those foreigners are rich even carrying us dollars they have weapons and vehicles some of them have even brought their families nangarhar mp esmatullah shinwari says according to some reports black flags have been seen in nangarhars haska mina district  and a former taliban local commander abdul khaleq is now claiming to be isis representative in that district farah senator haji gul ahmad azimi says according to the reports i have received from local officials in farah a number of foreign fighters  including women  have been seen in the district of khak safid wearing mostly black clothes and some with the arabic headscarf they have good vehicles and they are rich enough to buy food or goods at local shops for twice the normal value they are said to live in the mountainous areas of the khak safid district in abandoned mud houses and a month ago were rumored to be training in the area i cannot 100 confirm they are isis however wardak mp shir wali wardak says i dont think isis fighters from syria and iraq have come here to afghanistan  but hardcore taliban members who have understood that the taliban name is dying have changed the color of their flags from white to black in order to stay alive i know that some black flags have been seen in wardak province raised by extaliban fighters ghazni deputy

prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups of those cases 18 allegedly involve support to isis given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving homeland security is becoming a matter of hometown security homeland security secretary jeh johnson told reporters thursday the terrorist threat is more decentralized more diffuse more complicated it involves the potential lone wolf actor it involves the effective use of social media the internet in december velentzas and an undercover agent discussed the shooting deaths of two new york city police officers who were ambushed in brooklyn the shootings demonstrated how easy it is to kill a cop she said killing a police officer is easier than buying food she is quoted as saying in the complaint because sometimes one has to wait in line to buy food when the undercover agent later pointed out that more than 25000 officers had gathered for the funeral of one of the cops officer rafael ramos velentzas complimented the agent for coming up with an attractive potential target for a terror attack the

        "article": "cnn from late january when new england was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters to a warm and sunny afternoon in april the jurors in the firstdegree murder trial of former nfl star aaron hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brotherinlaw odin lloyd the jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the monthslong trial on wednesday they convicted hernandez who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days after the verdict jurors agreed to meet with reporters at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process here are five things to know about what they said  while declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision its a very big decision to make and every one of us  made sure we came to the best conclusion one juror told reporters at one point on monday jurors asked judge susan garsh to allow smoking breaks which were permitted during trial some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations a male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony it was hard  for everyone said a woman on the jury everyones life changed because of this asked to elaborate she told a reporter ive been here for as long as you have its the hardest thing ive ever done in my life she said later about serving on the jury absolutely by far asked whether they would say anything to hernandez one of the women on the panel said simply nothing others nodded in apparent agreement do they have any feelings about the 25yearold former star for me judge garsh said keep your mind suspended  said a female juror we went in there every day with open minds we listened to the evidence we heard what they had to say we got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and thats when we came to our conclusion did they know anything about hernandez or the case before the trial one juror responded nothing very little said another about six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a new england patriots fan the jurors said they found out about hernandezs other legal woes from garsh only after they reached a verdict hernandez potentially faces three more trials one criminal and two civil actions next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a boston nightclub in july 2012 prosecutors have said hernandez fatally shot daniel de abreu and safiro furtado when he fired into their 2003 bmw another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment the families of de abreu and furtado filed civil suits against hernandez and a judge froze his 5 million in assets pending the outcome of the doublemurder trial the freeze includes the disputed 33 million signing bonus payment hernandez claims he is owed by the new england patriots hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in miami in february 2013 alexander bradley claims hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a miami strip club its amazing a lot of the information we learned today a female juror said wednesday i think we can all say we made the right decision some jurors admitted to not knowing who patriots owner robert kraft was when he took the stand at the trial but they agreed that krafts testimony was crucial kraft testified that hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that he hoped that the time of the murder  came out because i believe he said he was in a club to this day  we just went through a threemonth trial and this is now two years later  we still dont know the exact time of odins murder a male juror said so i dont know how aaron would have had that information two years ago another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of lloyds family and friends for me it was in the beginning  the pictures a woman said of autopsy photos of lloyds bulletriddled body youre told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears  that was hard one man said his time on the case made him appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be and that the justice system can work the system is designed to be fair to both sides he said in fairness you cant rush the jurors did not find credible the defense teams contention that hernandezs codefendants  ernest wallace and carlos ortiz  carried out the murder the two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately in closing arguments defense lawyer james sultan for the first time placed hernandez at the murder scene sultan described wallace and ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on pcp as men capable of killing someone in druginduced fits of rage did he make all the right decisions no sultan said of hernandez he was a 23yearold kid who witnessed something committed by somebody he knew he really didnt know what to do so he put one foot in front of another keep in mind hes not charged with accessory after the fact  hes charged with murder  and that he did not do we were all shocked about that a female juror told reporters wednesday it was very surprising said another asked about posttrial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case a female juror smiled none of us wanted to come into this room she told the reporters gathered around her the jurors said they expected to sleep peacefully wednesday night after a beverage one of them added asked whether they were leaving the experience as friends they all seemed to say yes",

the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead now that he has been found guilty on every count the jury must decide whether boston marathon bomber tsarnaev 21 should live or die for what he has done this is the victim impact part of the case and the testimony was heartbreaking four young people are gone and grief fills the spaces they once occupied a father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called princess krystle was the light of my life she was extremely smart hardworking beautiful every fathers dream i miss her a lot said william a campbell sr dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter a 29yearold restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 boston marathon she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations he said nobody fills that boot now others are expected to come and cry for lingzi lu a jolly soul assistant us attorney nadine pellegrini said quoting the slain chinese grad students father more tears will be shed for martin richard who was 8 and looked just like his dad and for sean collier who was remembered at his memorial service by these words big heart big smiles big service all love dzhokhar tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain they had time to be scared and frightened but they had no time to say goodbye pellegrini told the jury and that is the very essence of terror timeline of bombings manhunt and aftermath  to understand the toll tsarnaevs bombs took jurors must know the stories of his victims the prosecutor said these young women this young man and this little boy all of them were loved and they loved in return pellegrini said before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable they were sons they were daughters they were grandchildren they were brothers and they were sisters jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings there was the photo of campbell as a little girl in a red tapdancing outfit and then came the one that made her father smile through his tears she was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform she traded that in for a bat campbell said she wasnt really a girly girl but she loved to whitewater camp play baseball she had a good arm on her i was very proud of her by contrast jurors also were left with an indelible image of tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held it is dated july 10 2013  the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the boston marathon he glares into the camera defiantly his middle finger raised in a profane salute this is dzhokhar tsarnaev unconcerned unrepentant and unchanged pellegrini said without remorse he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused tsarnaev saw the people he killed as the enemy she said as a result two women and a man never reached the age of 30 and a little boy never made it to the third grade he knew they were innocents he even called them that pellegrini added referring to the message tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings but it didnt stop him from murdering them the people who were maimed by tsarnaevs bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks the stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of tsarnaevs trial when the first of the two bombs went off gillian reny a senior in high school was standing near the woman she came to know was  krystle campbell there was a complete utter chilling silence and then chaos chaos like id never seen and never hope to see again she said the force of the blast knocked her to the ground when she looked around she saw blood and muscle everywhere her shin bone had snapped and was protruding muscle was everywhere it was the most horrifying image i could imagine just seeing that on my own body she said and began to cry i remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere blood everywhere were you bleeding she was asked yes enormously looking down at the blood i was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone she said i was terrified that i was going to die i did not know that i could be that injured and survive she said she began to scream her bonechilling cries could be heard on a video played in court  the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown doctors were able to save renys leg but others werent so lucky celeste corcoran lost both legs one below the knee and the other above the knee an amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from jurors have learned at this trial corcoran was at the finish line waiting for her sister to cross and then our whole world just exploded she said i unfortunately remember every single detail she remembers being knocked to the ground hearing nothing and then screams and seeing blood everywhere its kind of hard to explain but i want to get it right for all of you to understand she told the jury she said it was a surreal outofbody experience  she remembers thinking what was that and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack by then she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined she wondered if she would die it hurt too much i just didnt care she said i remember thinking i was going to die that no one could go through that much pain  i knew it was very bad and i was thinking is this it am i going to die i remember thinking i wanted to die the pain was too much i wanted to die and then she said the mom in me took over she remembers telling herself  hell no i dont want to die i have too much living to do dont let this be the end this cant be the end she remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs can i get on with my life absolutely she said but she can never forget shes a double amputee theres always a level of discomfort right now im not comfortable she said from the witness stand the bottoms of my limbs theres this constant numb burning sensation the only way i can describe it is its like you have the worst athletes foot in my life sometimes she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be you dont realize until youre a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are she said inclines are very hard daily life is literally an uphill battle opinion what tsarnaev deserves  cnns greg botelho contributed to this report",

        "article": "cnn president barack obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point after the event at washingtons howard university on tuesday obama sat down with me for a oneonone interview i asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average american to take away as well as how enforceable his action plan is here are five things i learned  the president enrolled at occidental college in los angeles in 1979 he transferred to columbia university his junior year while in la he said the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside he remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside he credits the clean air act with making americans a lot healthier in addition to being able to see the mountains in the background because they arent covered in smog obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken peerreviewed environmental protection agency studies say that the clean air act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction the epa estimates that between 1970 and 2010 the act and its amendments prevented 365000 early deaths from particulate matter alone no challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change the president told me when i asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health he said we know as temperatures rise insectborne diseases potentially start shifting up we know in a very straightforward fashion that heatstroke and other heatrelated illnesses and deaths potentially increase and so what were doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like hurricane sandy or big wildfires or droughts that people recognize theres a very personal potential impact in climate change and the good news is we can do something about it in many ways obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us while conceding that we dont fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health when asked what the average american can do about all this the president encouraged ordinary citizens doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change he also issued a presidential proclamation declaring april 612 as national public health week to better understand communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities the average american can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint including   change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights one cfl can reduce up to 1300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime if every house in the us switched its bulbs we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half  unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use according to the us department of energy this practice can save 100 a year on your energy bill  use a laptop instead of a desktop laptops are designed to be energyefficient because battery life is a major factor in their design according to energy star a laptop can be up to 80 more energyefficient than a desktop  filter your own water beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store  adjust your curtains and thermostats if you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter you can save big bucks on your energy bill the department of energy estimates you can save up to 15 on your bill by turning off your thermostat when youre not at home obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current supreme court challenge to the affordable care act he  said he believes the statute is clear and straightforward he said i am not anticipating the supreme court would make such a bad decision at issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so the plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the affordable care act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states without statebased exchanges possibly creating a situation for example in which people in massachusetts would receive a tax credit but people living in texas would not obama did tell me that if the supreme court challenge is upheld however there is no plan b millions of people would lose their health insurance they would no longer be able to afford the health insurance thats being provided out there obama went on to say i think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against the affordable care act for ideological reasons he told me that he gets letters every day from people who say you know what the affordable care act saved my life or saved my kids life because i got insurance i thought i was healthy turns out i had a tumor but because i went and got a checkup it was removed in time and im now cancerfree  he added i think stories like that will be factored in when the supreme court takes a look at this case cnns ben tinker contributed to this report",

        "article": "cnn on thursday president barack obama revealed that a us drone strike had killed warren weinstein and giovanni lo porto two aid workers held hostage on the afghanistanpakistan border al qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the united states and an end to drone strikes but it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages  take the case of jason rezaian the washington posts tehran bureau chief on april 20 just two days before diplomats resumed talks in vienna austria to reach a final agreement over irans nuclear program rezaians iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage conducting propaganda collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information with malicious intent the state department rezaians employers at the washington post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage their anger is justified but the decision should surprise no one there is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions humiliate the united states or signal unease the scale of irans current hostagetaking  not only rezaian but also iranianamericans saeed abedini and amir hekmati  may pale in comparison with iranian behavior of decades past but the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern consider the original iran hostage seizure on november 4 1979 radical students seized the american embassy in tehran ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days often forgotten was what sparked that episode which occurred more than nine months after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared the islamic revolution victorious the problem was a rush to reconcile at a november 1 1979 algiers reception zbigniew brzezinski president jimmy carters national security adviser met iranian prime minister mehdi bazargan according to brzezinskis own memoir he told bazargan that the united states was open to any relationship the islamic republic wanted photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world iranian hardliners meanwhile were apoplectic that barzagan was betraying irans revolutionary principles and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement khomeini endorsed their action our young people must foil these plots he reportedly said the hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands brzezinskis dream of reconciliation became a nightmare iran released the embassy hostages as ronald reagan took his oath of office ending its first but not last hostagetaking episode iranian proxies seized a number of americans in lebanon reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the nicaraguan contras the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also much as with obamas outreach today to solidify the moderate camp within the iranian political spectrum initially the scheme worked but no sooner had american officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free then kidnappers seized three more americans hostagetaking had simply become another way to collect concessions of course iran is not alone in such games whenever the united states tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold it faces hostage crises take north korea obama campaigned as the antibush on the world stage the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them  is ridiculous obama then a senator declared in july 2007 obama hadnt even marked two months in office when north korea detained two journalists working for al gores current tv a kangaroo court sentenced laura ling and euna lee to 12 years in prison it was traditional hostage diplomacy former president bill clinton traveled to pyongyang to appeal for their release north korean leader kim jong il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor kim jong un north koreas police force put out word that general kim jong uns artifice let former us president clinton cross the pacific to apologize to the great leader it was all made possible thanks to general kim jong uns extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics north koreas deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance ling and lee were neither the first nor the last americans that north korea seized during the obama era after north korea torpedoed a south korean ship killing 46 obama sought north koreas censure in the un security council pyongyang responded by threatening aijalon mahli gomes an american imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering north korea on cue former president jimmy carter arrived to mediate for gomes release called for new talks and by omission derailed efforts to hold north korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen south korean sailors the pattern would repeat in 2012 when north korea seized kenneth bae an american whom kim jong un sought to leverage into concessions the following year north korea arrested an 85yearold korean war veteran touring the hermit kingdom and the next year took two other tourists hostage each arrest resulted in a highlevel visit an apology to north korea that bolstered the dear leaders claims of strength and renewed engagement saddam hussein likewise worked from the same playbook in march 1995 iraqi security forces seized two american defense contractors who strayed into iraq from kuwait sentenced to eight years they served 114 days before rep bill richardson dnew mexico a close clinton ally and future cabinetlevel un ambassador flew to baghdad to retrieve them the american media lauded richardson but his trip was not without cost saddam used it to depict iraq as strong and america as weak president saddam hussein  accepts the pleas by bill clinton the congress and american people the iraqi news agency reported and so did the taliban fifteen years before obama traded alleged american deserter bowe bergdahl for five highvalue taliban and alleged al qaeda operatives imprisoned at guantanamo bay the taliban arrested two americans female missionaries their detention  and threatened death sentence  came against the backdrop of clintonera attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the taliban the taliban too knew how holding americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions so what does irans hostage brinkmanship portend diplomats drink their own koolaid and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold ego ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries hostages such as rezaian are canaries in the coal mine however their captivity  not suave officials and their smooth promises  show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy",

        "article": "cnn freddie gray did not get timely medical care after he was arrested and was not buckled into a seat belt while being transported in a police van baltimore police said friday police commissioner anthony batts told reporters there are no excuses for the fact that gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station five days after grays death and amid ongoing protests police officials acknowledged mistakes were made during and after his arrest gray who was stopped april 12 after a foot pursuit through several housing complexes should have received medical attention at the scene of his arrest said deputy police commissioner kevin davis a witness said the man was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing batts told reporters in an afternoon news conference we know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times investigators are trying to learn more about grays condition at each of the three stops the van made on its way to a police station at the first stop gray was placed in leg irons the driver stopped a second time to deal with mr gray and the facts of that interaction are under investigation davis said the van stopped one more time to add a second prisoner batts told reporters that at the third stop an officer saw gray on the floor of the van asking for a medic the officer and the van driver picked him up and put him on the seat the commissioner said when the van arrived at the western district station police called for an ambulance said davis who is in charge of the investigation an attorney for the gray family said it was positive news but there is a more important issue its certainly a step towards acknowledging the truth that the police did not follow their own internal regulations jason downs told cnns erin burnett outfront what it does not get at is it does not get at the core of this case and that is why did mr gray need medical attention in the first place   thats the question that still has not been answered the developments came two days after a police union attorney spoke of the possibility that the injuries occurred during a rough ride a frequently claimed practice in which police vehicles are deliberately driven in a way that injures suspects at least two suspects have won court cases against the city after being left paralyzed in such rides over the last decade or so the baltimore sun reported thursday gray died sunday one week after baltimore police arrested him at some point he suffered a severe spinal cord injury his family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died batts said he had been given preliminary results of an autopsy on gray the medical examiners full autopsy may take another 30 to 45 days batts said because toxicology tests still need to be examined and spinal experts may be brought in to assess grays injury meanwhile anger over the incident and the police response to it continued to grow ahead of a major rally that organizers vowed would shut this city down on saturday the people are demanding immediate arrests immediate end to the protracted investigation and immediate end to the stonewalling said malik shabazz president of black lawyers for justice but he and other officials vowed the protests would be peaceful  much as they were thursday night despite a few scuffles and two detentions no one has come to try and burn baltimore down another protest organizer the rev tim sutton told reporters mayor stephanie rawlingsblake thanked those protesters who have demonstrated peacefully our community is very clear they demand answers and so do i she said the mayor said that will take some time but she had concerns about what happened to gray i still want to know why the policies and procedures for transport were not followed rawlingsblake said i realize there is frustration over this investigation but i want to be clear there is a process but we have to respect that process batts addressed calls for his resignation after grays death by saying he would not step down police first encountered gray as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity when gray saw them authorities said he started running gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him an attorney for grays family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size one video of grays arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van his legs dangling limply behind him his leg look broke a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video that witness who only wants to be identified as kiona said she knew gray as a joker and a ladies man but that day he said only one thing to her when i ran up the street and seen him the first thing i asked him was he ok because i heard him screaming kiona said he didnt never say yes or no he just said i cant breathe and just was yelling grays family attorneys and protesters said police didnt have any probable cause to chase him but did so only because he was running while black police union attorney michael davey said officers had every right to give chase there is a supreme court case that states that if you are in a highcrime area and you flee from the police unprovoked the police have the legal ability to pursue you and thats what they did he said in this type of an incident you do not need probable cause to arrest you just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop andrew oconnell an attorney for the gray family said police have a lot of questions that need to be answered what was the reasonable suspicion why were they arresting our client he said he had no weapon in his hand he was committing no crime and he wasnt hurting anybody the police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him the attorney said the gray family has not yet seen the preliminary autopsy report attorney william murphy said downs said the family has commissioned an independent autopsy while police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators the department has not released details of what the officers said or how gray might have suffered the fatal injury the sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions batts said baltimore protests 5 questions demonstrators are asking  the justice department is investigating whether grays civil rights were violated during the arrest rawlingsblake said earlier she absolutely believes an outside investigation is needed especially given the history of police misconduct a wake will be held sunday for gray with a memorial service and funeral following on monday cnns holly yan carolyn sung ashley fantz kimberly

        "article": "cnn president abraham lincoln never lost his ardor for the united states to remain united during the civil war in his second inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plans for putting it into practice with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right he orated let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations the spirit of lincolns second inaugural was selfevident on april 9 1865  150 years ago  when confederate gen robert e lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28000 troops to union general ulysses s grant at appomattox courthouse mclean house in virginia  over 600000 americans  northerners and southerners alike  had perished in the bloody civil war  but the carnage was now about to end the historic meeting between grant and lee began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the mexican war  the good fellowship was palpable  lee in fact had to abruptly remind the chatty grant about the diplomatic business at hand   after all they were at appomattox courthouse to hash out terms of surrender grant purposely ended up being generous to confederate soldiers they would be paroled not condemned to prison camps  rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms  personal property of southerners would now be respected  even rations were provided by grant for lees hungry soldiers it was palm sunday and in the spirit of christian reconciliation grant ordered that no celebration occur within union army ranks  the confederates were now our prisoners grant wrote and we did not want to exult over their downfall the mythmaking about appomattox started from the moment lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to richmond   surrendering hadnt been easy for lee  sullen from defeat his own family property in arlington had been confiscated by union forces converted into a union cemetery with lines of white crosses on the lawn all 11000 acres of his virginia land holdings had been stripped from him by the us government  with no real home lee rode to richmond depressed and destitute rendezvousing with his sick wife mary curtis lee at a spare apartment  remarkably the stoic lee didnt express bitterness in public when news reached lee that lincoln had been murdered in fact he was distraught calling it a crime that was unexampled and deplorable although much remained unresolved between the victors and vanquished the little courthouse became a symbol of unity just like the star spangled banner from the war of 1812 one postappomattox story that has long interested me was that of littleberry walker  after being present at lees dramatic surrender at appomattox walker a battlefatigued confederate laid down his rifle and journeyed back to redclay georgia traveling mainly on foot passing ragged clusters of rebel amputees many hobbling on bayonet crutches others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction home upon arriving in atlanta a weary walker found the confederate railroadcity smoldered in ruin the handiwork of gen william t shermans scorched earth policy  onehundredtwenty years later walkers greatgrandson 39th president jimmy carter would construct his carter center an ngo dedicated to diplomatically resolving global conflicts on the very hilltop overlooking atlanta on which gen sherman once stood upon leaving atlanta walker continued walking south anxious for his kinfolk  unfortunately he returned to sumter county only to learn that his father had died and that the family farm was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy one suspects inman the main character of novelist charles fraziers cold mountain spoke for the battlehardened civil war veterans like walker when he lamented that what you have lost will not be returned to you  it will always be lost  youre left with only your scars to mark the void  all you can do is go on or not  but if you go on its knowing you carry scars with you as we reflect on the sesquicentennial of lees surrender at that forlorn virginia courthouse today marvelously maintained by the national park service we recognize that the scars of the civil war are still with us  the masondixon line divide still exists  almost all the old confederate states are now considered red republican while the union states are blue democrat  a residual variation of big federal government versus states rights paradigm of the civil war era while the old spiritual slavery chain done broke at last was sung by blacks in the hours following the appomattox surrender racism sadly continues to be a crippling national scourge while there no longer are beatings in congress like in 1856 when preston brooks of south carolina caned charles sumner of massachusetts on the congressional floor the gridlock on capital hill in 2015 the inability to get anything done is similarly coldcocking the spirit of our participatory democracy all american eyes should be fixated on appomattox today  the mclean house is our collective sanctuary of national healing  as a public place the mclean parlor remains small but the legacy which grant and lee made at the truce table is timeless in world history for while the scars of the monstrous civil war still remain the wounds have closed since 1865 in large part because of the civility of grant and lee  with grace and dignity these brave west point generals gave righteous credence to lincolns with malice toward none finery",

        "article": "los angeles cnn shes one of the hottest and most successful latinas in hollywood but now sofia vergara is playing defense in a legal battle initiated by her exfiance he wants to keep the two frozen embryos from their relationship both female the 42yearold actress and star of the hit tv sitcom modern family split from businessman nick loeb in may 2014 loeb is suing the colombianborn actress in los angeles to prevent vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in november 2013 according to published reports by new york daily news and in touch magazine the lawsuit cited by the two publications however lists the plaintiff as joe doe and the defendant as jane doe the suit doesnt identify the names of the actual litigants instead the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals privacy the two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports on tuesday loebs attorney abram moore confirmed in a statement that loeb filed the lawsuit representatives for vergara declined to comment court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged and their plan was to eventually have children together on modern family vergara plays gloria delgado pritchett an eccentric and voluptuous colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby but the sitcom makebelieve is far from what vergara is dealing with now the lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by jane doe until both parties reach an agreement the suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held the art reproductive center in beverly hills the center didnt respond to a message seeking comment friday according to the legal paperwork the excouple had already used two surrogate mothers one being a close friend of jane does in an attempt to have children however neither of the implantations was successful in his own statement loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term but he doesnt want any money from the egg donor his statement doesnt directly identify vergara as the donor other than referring to his ex i have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future should she change her mind loeb said he believes that life begins at fertilization he said creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations even where a man doesnt want to become a father where a man does want to become a father and wants to impose no obligations on the other party he should have that corresponding right  however life comes to be created it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent loeb said in an interview with abc in april 2013 while the couple was still engaged vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it we just wanted to plan ahead my boyfriend nick is three years younger than me and hes never had a son i have my son manolo so its not that important you know its not like an emergency for me to have another kid for nick yes because hes never had a baby vergara said during the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with loeb i already froze some eggs so you know i wanted to take advantage of science why not vergara said the abc anchor asked vergara how far along she was in the process to which the actress replied i took them out already theyre in a refrigerator laughing she added hopefully theyll be fresh by the time i use them the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos typically a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority said fertility specialist dr david tourgeman whos not involved in this case usually when embryos are created whether the couple is married or just consenting adults theres usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos if they are frozen for future use he said in most cases the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney although anyone can make a request tourgeman said if theres a disagreement the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos he said the documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners he said in the scenario where theres a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to it will usually be decided by a court of law but experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues religious moral issues to legal and contract issues when does life begin are these embryos alive said california attorney vance owen to catholics for example conception marks the beginning of life to abortion advocates the child has to be in a more advanced state perhaps the third trimester so its a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues owen said owen said loeb has a case because no court in california will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree this case is a gray area of law because its new owen said its developing as we speak he said its a question i think of whether to decide if these frozen embryosare human beings or whether they are property since they are unborn some states in the united states look at these embryos not as life but as property owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by loeb will now open new issues and a california court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong these embryos are not inside her body he said they are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in beverly hills so there the planned parenthood of central missouri vs danforth case cannot be used by the sofia vergara team to allege that the embryos would present some danger to her health as they did in that case in that case the us supreme court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional the lawsuit comes as vergara promotes her new movie hot pursuit with costar reese witherspoon vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor joe manganiello cnns krecyte villarreal and stella chan contributed to this report",

        "article": "cnn if one is to believe lawyers for aaron hernandez the former new england patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend his future brotherinlaw and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chainsmoked the jury in the highprofile trial resumed deliberations wednesday after deliberating about an hourandahalf on tuesday the way defense lawyer james sultan laid it out for the massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier tuesday why would a young man with a 40 million contract kill semipro player odin lloyd less than a mile from his own home why would hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene did those who sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the national football league if there was evidence of any reason aaron would have had to murder odin loyd dont you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks sultan asked the jury you didnt hear it because it doesnt exist the prosecution however portrayed hernandez as cold calculating and insecure  a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others prosecutor william mccauley asked jurors what was hernandez talking about a day after lloyds bulletriddled body was found at a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013  my endorsements are gone  hernandez said according to mccauley said hes not talking about odin the states largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence on monday hernandezs defense gave its side of the story in less than a day in closing arguments the next day sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt even if they found a strong likelihood that hernandez was involved the lawyer said thats not enough sultan tried to implicate hernandezs codefendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately the defense described wallace and ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on pcp as men capable of killing someone in druginduced fits of rage theyre accused of killing lloyd did he make all the right decisions no sultan said of his client he was a 23yearold kid who witnessed something committed by somebody he knew he really didnt know what to do so he put one foot in front of another keep in mind hes not charged with accessory after the fact  hes charged with murder  and that he did not do the prosecution said wallace and ortiz were longtime friends of hernandez who had complete control of them mccauley reminded the jury of testimony about hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying drinking smoothies and hernandez at times leaving his then 8monthold child with the two men these guys  will do whatever he wants the prosecutor said of hernandez the motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out but prosecutors said lloyd might have done or said something that didnt sit well with hernandez they said hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score mccauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone  such as disrespect  would easily offend hernandez hernandezs fiancee shayanna jenkins testified that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couples home that she said reeked of marijuana she also said she didnt know what was in the box the prosecution has said the murder weapon which has not been recovered was in the box after concealing the box with her daughters clothing jenkins said she threw it away in a random dumpster but could not remember where another piece of the states case was grainy footage from hernandezs home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a 45caliber handgun  the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park which is about a mile from hernandezs home the video is timestamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks  the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving hernandezs lawyers showed a different part of the video timestamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand they suggested it was an ipad evidence collected in lloyds death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub that double shooting took place in july 2012 almost a year before lloyd was killed he will be tried in that case after the lloyd trial the jury has not heard about the double shooting cnns susan candiotti and laura dolan contributed to

it says tradition the cowboys way a few mourners trickled into the fielding home for funerals in charleston south carolina charleston mayor joseph riley comes by to pay his respects and show support for the scott family they are not at friday nights visitation the mayor says  the stress of the past week since scott was fatally shot in the back by a north charleston police officer michael slager is too much they went by the funeral home earlier but they are exhausted he says they need their privacy now and at saturdays funeral and burial he says this is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community he says adding they share the grief of their neighbors in north charleston and with the scott family it breaks everyones hearts wherever we live meanwhile police continue to investigate the incident in which scott ran from his car after a traffic stop then was shot while fleeing from slager on friday afternoon police met with a man who was in scotts car when slager pulled it over for a broken taillight the passengers name wasnt in a police report obtained by cnn the passenger was detained briefly after the shooting one officer wrote in the report scott family attorney chris stewart said the man with scott was a coworker and friend but he did not identify the friend by name nor did thom berry a south carolina law enforcement division spokesman who confirmed fridays meeting slager has been fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on a murder charge video shot by a witness shows the officer shooting scott in the back as he runs away slager had told investigators he feared for his safety after he and scott tussled over his taser his lawyer andy savage said friday he has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has savages office said in a written statement that it has yet to receive any investigative documents audio or video tapes other than a copy of mr slagers arrest warrant the news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that slager belongs to is no longer involved in the case on thursday dash cam video and a new witness emerged from the day scott died the dash cam footage shows slager talking calmly to scott during the traffic stop scott apparently says he has no insurance on the vehicle and slager returns to his car to do paperwork moments later scott gets out of his car and bolts a foot chase ensues scott never reappears on the dash cam video but a witness later takes video of the officer shooting scott several times in the back as he is running away nothing in this video demonstrates that the officers life or the life of another was threatened national urban league president marc morial said the question here is whether the use of force was excessive on thursday a new witness emerged in the case gwen nichols told cnns brian todd that she saw a scuffle between scott and slager at the entrance to a vacant lot it was like a tussle type of thing like you know like what do you want or what did i do type of thing nichols said i didnt hear mr slager saying stop  scott was the subject of a bench warrant over 1810443 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop according to court records that may be why he ran an attorney for the family said criminal defense attorney paul callan said he believes slagers defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting  that this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation a physical altercation with a suspect callan said and that would constitute manslaughter under law as opposed to murder and it makes a huge difference in sentencing in south carolina a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation what we know about officer slager  the investigation has been turned over to the south carolina law enforcement division or sled in a statement released thursday sled said its investigators found troubling inconsistencies from the very start we believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter sled chief mark keel said in a statement the cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions feidin santana who took the video of the shooting told cnns anderson cooper that he was walking to work when he saw slager on top of scott who was on the ground he said he could hear the sound of a taser in use santana said he didnt see scott go after the taser as slager initially claimed he said he believes scott was trying to get away mr scott never tried to fight santana said neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video because santana started recording shortly after that his video shows scott running away from slager before the officer aims his gun slager fires eight shots toward scott striking him five times a timeline of events  while the initial traffic stop may have seemed to be perfectly normal and professional and the foot chase a reasonable choice an analyst saw little justification for that last act im not familiar with south carolina police training but i guarantee you that they do not teach to shoot a fleeing unarmed man in the back said jim bueermann president of the police foundation a washingtonbased nonprofit there are several claims in the initial police reports that are not supported in santanas video and there may be more to the investigation than just whether scotts killing was justified cnn legal analyst danny cevallos said if its determined that multiple officers attempted to cover for the shooting officer and its shown that those reports were false this will be a devastating blow for law enforcement everywhere he said who was walter scott

        "article": "cnn change is coming to ferguson in the next few weeks the department of justice doj will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination it should not be forgotten that the doj review of the ferguson police department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of michael brown by a ferguson police officer and by revelations about the towns dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups now after a half year of unrest and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members change is beginning to come to ferguson the question is what kind of change the report from the department of justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens through illegal traffic stops and arrests and the use of excessive force the police department held town residents in bondage the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time court costs and fees constituted the secondlargest sources of revenue for the town rather than a force for public safety the ferguson police department became according to attorney general eric holder a collection agency  one that preyed disproportionately on the towns africanamerican residents the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating it included blatantly racist emails traded among officers and evidence that africanamericans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department but just a few weeks before the release of the report the ferguson police chief declared there were no racial issues in his department fergusons ugly racist emails released  the recommendations in the report ranging from new training and supervision of police officers addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system will if implemented remake the law enforcement system in the town a grand jury that investigated the shooting of brown by officer darren wilson chose not to file charges against him and the justice department also didnt find reason to prosecute without question change is coming to the towns government town manager john shaw fergusons most powerful official and until the dojs blistering report the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the citys deputy manager three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and on tuesday citizens elected two black candidates to the city council changing its racial composition five of six members and the mayor were white now the council will be 50 black fergusons hapless police chief thomas jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a monthslong display of astonishing incompetence the department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests  the appointment of a commander from the state highway patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest jacksons departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council there will be a new police chief in ferguson but does that mean that fundamental change will come to ferguson not necessarily not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks the department of justices fullon negotiations with the leadership in ferguson will determine the shape of the new ferguson police department indeed the doj report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with st louis county many local activists have suggested just such a solution but given ongoing problems with policing in the county  including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in ferguson last fall  community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the doj can fold st louis county police into its monitoring and reform process equally important were the april 7 general elections turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in ferguson with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than africanamericans but local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and getoutthevote campaigns the mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign although a petition for his recall has been circulating that means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the doj to remake the police department has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks community activists and residents must ensure that mayor james knowles plans to represent their vision of new ferguson police department but there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in ferguson and throughout st louis county fergusons governing structure with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the united states that form of governance might have been precisely what thriving middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like st louis but working class suburbs like ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents may need a more robust form of governance in any case a system in which the elected officials have minimal power but nonelected leaders like the town manager and the chief of police have inordinate power is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable nonrepresentative government that controlled fergusons residents yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country likewise missouri like the vast majority of states holds municipal elections in nonpresidential election years guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout  although only a few states hold the primary and general election in march and april as missouri law requires ferguson to do its not that ferguson is so different than towns across america its precisely because ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in st louis county plagued by similar governance flaws including those towns led by africanamericans and fergusons example should provoke selfexamination in working class suburbs across the country where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population change is coming to ferguson but the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical american town",

        "article": "cnn were 2 degrees from a different world humans never have lived on a planet thats 2 degrees celsius 36 fahrenheit warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels in the late 1800s and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2degree mark this is gambling with the planet said gernot wagner the lead senior economist at the environmental defense fund and coauthor of the book climate shock think super droughts rising seas and mass extinctions yet for all of its importance i dont think the 2degree threshold is as famous as it should be ive heard it referred to as the north star for climate negotiations meaning this one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the worlds attention its so significant that its going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year im calling that effort 2 degrees and i need your help to make it work until 5 pm et monday you can vote on the first story ill report for the series vote using the facebook poll below or go here if you dont see it tell cnns john sutter which of these climate change stories you like best  and hell report on the winner this poll closes monday april 27 at 5pm et 2degrees  all of those story ideas came from you by the way they focus on what a 2degree world might look like cnn kicked off this effort with a facebook chat last week we asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2degree threshold specifically i dont have all the answers right now well continue to explore the importance of this number together but below youll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number many of them come straight from you the readers and i tossed in a couple of my own if youd like to follow this project as it evolves id encourage you to sign up for the 2 degrees newsletter and feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below theyll shape the way i spend the rest of the year reporting on this supercritical number one guy it turns out william nordhaus an economist at yale nordhaus 73 proposed the 2degree threshold in a 1977 1977 paper titled economic growth and climate the carbon dioxide problem the estimate was crude but it was a reasonable first start he told me if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years he wrote in the climate casino a growing body of research now supports the idea science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2degree world is something none of us should want you need a judgment call for these things said carlo jaeger chair of the global climate forum who has written on the history of 2 degrees celsius and this 2degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal jaeger told me that happened in the 1990s later came the european commission the g8 the us national academy of sciences and most significantly the copenhagen accord which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much the united states was among the signatories im going to spend the month of may exploring this question so look for more on this but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post2degree world to look like these are pulled from reports by the national research council  the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the world bank  wildfires in the united states are expected to increase 400 to 800 in size  hurricanes are expected to become 2 to 8 more intense a range of species will be at risk for extinction particularly amphibians the ipcc estimates 20 to 30 of animals and plants species will be at increasingly high risk of extinction at or near the 2degree mark the arctic is expected keep melting losing 30 of its annual average sea ice certain crop yields in the united states india and africa are expected to decrease 10 to 30 the availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20 so  not good and numbers dont convey the emotional toll im from new mexico said nordhaus the economist who proposed the 2degree threshold i love it there and i know its going to be a completely different climate the trout fishing probably wont be as good the hiking wont be as good these forests may look completely different or burn down i love to ski its one of my things i love most and thats obviously affected by warming i love the ocean and the new england coastline and its in peril thats just for starters no one knows exactly think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit  or a zone of increased risk katharine hayhoe a climate scientist at texas tech told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking how many cigarettes give you cancer no one knows exactly but the more you smoke the more you up your risk and 2 degrees policy experts agree is certainly risky territory plus everyone hates a fraction targeting 1 degree of warming is ridiculous because you cant do it said nordhaus the economist three sounds too high and you cant have a fraction because its too complicated so two is kind of an obvious number the climate already has warmed 085 degrees since the industrial revolution and we reasonably can expect to reach 15 degrees simply based on the pollution were already putting into the atmosphere even with very ambitious mitigation action to reduce carbon emissions according to a 2014 report from the world bank some of that warming is lockedin to the earths atmospheric system that organization says the impacts of climate change already are being felt yes but it wont be easy if you want to stay below 2 degrees you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed  to an incredible degree said jaeger from the global climate forum heres the best guess for what that amazing speed might need to look like cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 to 90 by 2050 said jennifer morgan global director of the climate program at the world resources institute it depends on how much risk you want to accept she said some activists including those from 350org and avaaz which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in new york want to accept less risk than that our position is 100 clean energy said david sievers a senior campaigner for avaaz if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury scarier still we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100 some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2degree target saying its too ambitious or even naive but we need a yardstick to measure progress  and we need that north star to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem if you think 2 degrees sounds bad 5 degrees is far far worse the ipcc expects a 5degree world to be characterized by major extinctions around the globe and a reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide just beyond that at 6 degrees were looking a catastrof that would be almost infinitely costly said wagner the environmental defense fund economist its akin to killing the planet basically or society on the planet this much should be clear something has to change if we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3 thats still better or less awful than 5 or 6 whats important is that we maintain a sense of urgency and keep sight of the goal please be in touch i need your help to make this work email questions to climate at cnn dot com subscribe to the 2 degrees newsletter follow the project on facebook twitter and instagram",

        "article": "cnn well the thought experiments are finally over hillary clintons online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be and nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign should she win clinton will add to her potential firsts first woman president the first president who had been a first lady theres another one too the first secretary of state to become president since james buchanan only a handful of the nations top diplomats have gone to the white house thomas jefferson james madison james monroe john quincy adams martin van buren and buchanan and none in the 20th century a curious fact that suggests politics and statecraft are quite different animals too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire ambition and temperament to compete for the top job still on balance clintons tenure at the state department should be a real advantage during the campaign particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective republican rivals but this will be no cake walk for her on the foreign policy side clinton will have to negotiate and traverse several tricky and rocky paths to ensure that her state department career remains an advantage and doesnt turn into a liability heres why  the last president to serve in a top job in the administration of his immediate predecessor was george hw bush  circumstances were different then far from wanting to distance himself from reagan bush 41 saw merit in reinforcing the association with a president who dominated his day in a way few chief executives have clinton will face a harder balancing act how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in obamas first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak vacillating and fairly or not responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse especially in the middle east and with russia than when president obama took office in the process shell have to define her own approach to the world indeed given the presidents vulnerabilities on foreign policy she cant afford to be seen as obamas third term in her memoir hard choices shes already laid the foundation for distancing herself from obama on issues such as doing more for the syrian opposition and being tougher on russias vladimir putin and she can legitimately work to sharpen those differences without seeming to walk away from policies she supported and leaving herself open to charges that she has no principles only politically expedient tactics too much loyalty to a president who is unpopular among independents will hurt her but so will flipflopping nowhere will her challenges be greater than on iran clinton presided over the secret channel that laid the basis for the november 2013 interim accord and led directly to the putative understandings reached between the united states and iran earlier this month in lausanne switzerland and she certainly can take credit for pushing tough sanctions that forced iran to the table the problem of course is that her republican opponents and more than a few democrats hate what the negotiations have produced much less enamored with the obamas lets engage our enemies trope clinton may have doubts herself the good news is that there wont be an agreement for months so for now she can back the importance of tough negotiating and even tougher sanctions or worse should the iranians cheat  but sooner or later perhaps as early as june if theres an agreement clinton will have to take a stand on what may well be a very problematic and unpopular accord and what congress role should be her opponents the israelis and much of the organized jewish community will portray it as even worse and that is likely to be somewhat problematic and will be hyped as even worse and this will put her at odds with traditional friends and supporters in the jewish community frankly given her political interests it would be easier for her candidacy if the agreement fell apart and she could campaign on a tough antiiranian message hammering the mullahs repressive policies at home and their mischiefmaking in the region she may not be that lucky still she will have an advantage in dealing with the proisraeli community unlike president obama the clintons have strong credentials on the israeli issue and that will help somewhat in trying to walk a narrow line between a negotiating process with iran that clinton launched and its fruits which are seen by many israelis and american jews right now as too generous to the mullahs clintons time at the state department should help her in a presidential campaign where americans are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the white house the republicans will try and show that benghazi and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she didnt accomplish much clinton wasnt a henry kissinger or a james baker but given the problems she confronted  iran stalled israelipalestinian twostate negotiations none ready for any kind of solution or breakthrough and a president who dominated rather than delegated foreign policy she performed ably enough she improved the nations image and pushed 21st century issues such as womens rights youth and the environment her critics will dismiss all this as a kind of naive planetary humanism still four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential  to lead america in a dangerous and turbulent world  and in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs that can only help clintons biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the riskreadiness of george w bush and the riskaversion of barack obama  and given the cruel and unforgiving nature of the world america now inhabits this will be no easy task",

        "article": "cnn the shootings main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed outside of that the highly publicized police shootings in ferguson and north charleston bear only mild resemblance so whats changed between the shooting death of michael brown in ferguson missouri in august and that of walter scott in north charleston south carolina last weekend and did the backlash and publicity of the ferguson shooting influence the handling of the north charleston incident its tough to say for sure but here are some of the stark differences in the cases the lessons learned by both police and the public and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future ferguson officer darren wilson said he shot brown after the two struggled over wilsons gun and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts  often conflicting  of where wilson was where brown was and whether brown was surrendering or charging the officer north charleston though its unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone its 100 clear from the video that scott was not posing a threat to officer michael slager when the policeman opened fire on scott as he ran away takeaway where browns killing was a breeding ground for speculation  with a stark divide between those who said wilson was justified and those who said brown was senselessly slain  no such debate has emerged in the scott shooting it would be tough to extrapolate for certain but its possible that the clearcut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer and that quick reaction by authorities in south carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in ferguson as the process of determining wilsons fate dragged on for months ferguson black residents outnumber whites in the st louis suburb by more than a 2to1 ratio yet at the time of browns shooting there were only three black officers on the citys 53member force and there was only one africanamerican member of the sixmember city council two more africanamericans were voted in during this weeks citys elections north charleston its closer to an even split here with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47 black and 42 white the makeup of the citys police department is unclear though its been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 black three of the 10 city council members are black takeaway the ratio of white and black officers on the north charleston police department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the ferguson police department but both are considerably off as for the city councils the latest election in ferguson makes its governing body more representative than north charlestons but before you place too much emphasis on the percentages there are other variables to consider like policing methods as cnn political commentator marc lamont hill pointed out changing the racial makeup of a department alone wont do the trick if officers arent taught the best practices black people didnt march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us he said i want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly we need communitybased policing if were going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods ferguson there was no bystander video of michael browns death  no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired north charleston its unlikely slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness feidin santana even north charlestons police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of scotts shooting not only does the video show slager firing eight shots at scott as hes running away it also shows him placing a darkcolored object next to scotts lifeless body that could be significant because slager initially said scott had taken his taser and he feared for his life but if investigators determine the object dropped next to scotts body was actually the taser slager could be accused of planting evidence the takeaway ferguson resident alexis templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves the video of the north charleston shooting she said is vital if there is no video folks dont believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country she said but with a video you cant say its not happening ferguson the largely peaceful protests in ferguson were marred by looting arson and even shootings violence erupted again in november after darren wilson the officer who shot brown wasnt indicted and even after fergusons police chief resigned last month two officers were shot during a protest at the ferguson police department north charleston after scott was killed in south carolina over the weekend protests in north charleston have been peaceful so far the takeaway some ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way north charleston is handling its own tragedy lee smith who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a ferguson city council seat said he was glad to see authorities in south carolina charge slager with murder i am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in ferguson smith said ferguson it took ferguson police six days to publicly identify wilson as the officer who shot brown and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting thenpolice chief thomas jackson decided not to visit browns family and rather than charge wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit  as many civil rights advocates wanted  the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer north charleston slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on tuesday two days after santana shared his video with scotts family mayor keith summey denounced the shooting and said slager made a bad decision both summey and the police chief also visited scotts family when youre wrong youre wrong he said and if you make a bad decision  dont care if youre behind the shield or just a citizen on the street  you have to live by that decision the takeaway former ferguson mayor brian fletcher said the city has influenced others i think these situations are given much more scrutiny now said fletcher who won a seat on fergusons city council this week they have seen what has happened here in ferguson every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do ferguson after browns death in august many asked why wilson didnt have a body camera the shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels three months later president barack obama pledged 263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50000 police officers north charleston slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed scott but after the shooting the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras so every officer on the street in the city will have one thats in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered summey said the takeaway not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras some police unions have scoffed at the idea and the american civil liberties union has cited privacy concerns theyre also expensive several camera models cost at least 500 each and storing all that footage can cost as much as 20000 a year but national urban league president marc morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public but also police i think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis its going to protect good officers who do the right thing morial said but its also going to ferret out if you will bad actions by bad officers cnns moni basu gregory wallace and wolf blitzer contributed to the report",

constitutional right to marry the question at the core of obergefell v hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting samesex marriage but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nations highest court led by roberts appointed to the bench by president george w bush roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to samesex marriage he dissented in united states v windsor a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act which denied federal benefits to lawfully married samesex couples and hes expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow samesex marriage bans yet both sides see the case as a legacymaking moment for the 60yearold chief justice and advocates for samesex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how hell vote  and whether he will upset some conservatives once again if the windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the roberts court said judith e schaeffer of the constitutional accountability center which is advocating for samesex marriage will john roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision for some conservatives a vote in favor of samesex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice david souter who was nominated to the bench by george hw bush and who retired in 2009 consistently voted with the liberals or when justice anthony kennedy a ronald reagan appointee disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty or when roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the governments taxing authority the hope in conservative circles is that roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of samesex marriage gets decided by the people not the courts the chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the constitution said edward whelan president of the ethics and public policy center blatherings about the wrong side of history are an appeal to intellectual cowardice those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the windsor case in his majority opinion kennedy said the principal purpose of the defense of marriage act was to impose inequality roberts disagreed he wrote separately to say he thought congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide uniformity and stability at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman roberts picked up on kennedys language that emphasized the states power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions david cruz of the university of southern california gould school of law said that roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the obergefell case roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding samesex couples from marriage cruz said indeed the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in michigan tennessee ohio and kentucky in the obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage another clue to roberts thinking in the windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the defense of marriage act was passed out of a desire to harm  noting it had the support of majorities in both the house of representatives and the senate as well as president bill clinton who signed it into law i would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry roberts wrote the comments suggest he would reject an argument in the obergefell case that rested on the idea that samesex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people but backers of samesex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own schaeffer points out that roberts didnt join the parts of the dissents penned by justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and samuel alito which clearly stated a belief that state bans on samesex marriage dont violate the constitution roberts didnt join them in expressing those views schaeffer said at the time roberts simply wrote that the court does not have before it and the logic of its opinion does not decide whether states can ban samesex marriage schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasnt before the court but i think one reasonable explanation is that roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality she said the defense of marriage act decision overshadowed another 2013 case  hollingsworth v perry  that could have determined whether states could ban samesex marriage the case concerned a challenge to californias proposition 8 a state constitutional amendment that barred samesex couples from marriage but roberts writing for the majority dismissed the case holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated proposition 8 and thus paved the way for samesex marriage in california roberts lesbian cousin who lives in california sat in the courtroom during arguments in the prop 8 case few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the supreme court but waves of lower court judges  sometimes citing windsor  struck down the state bans on the first day of the term last fall the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases but conventional wisdom was completely wrong without comment the court declined to take up any of the cases clearing the way for thousands of additional samesex marriages the courts vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known but some speculate on one possible scenario roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in windsor then again even if the speculation were true it doesnt reveal much about roberts thinking theres a big difference between voting not to take up a case which expresses no opinions on the merits and issuing an opinion on the merits and even when roberts actions  such as effectively allowing samesex marriage to proceed in california  seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking when the institution of marriage developed historically people didnt get around and say lets have this institution but lets keep out homosexuals  roberts said during the proposition 8 oral arguments the institution developed to serve purposes that by their nature didnt include homosexual couples",

        "article": "western australia cnn many australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of andrew chan and myuran sukumaran the death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel consequently indonesias actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states  or more accurately to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment as german sociologist max weber pointed out one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence state officials can order people to be killed because  especially in democracies  we authorize them to do so we can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate  as is clearly the case in indonesia  its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest less prominent victims of statesanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked however disappointed we may be in the actions of indonesian president joko widodo  in whom so many inside and outside indonesia have invested such hopes as a progressive force  he can make a couple of claims in his defense first widodo  popularly known as jokowi  is indonesias elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other indonesians see as a problem indonesias domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver this is not a justification for his actions but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy whatever we may think about the underlying principles and administration of justice in indonesia at least jokowi can claim that it is essentially a domestic issue we may not like indonesias laws but they are being applied evenhandedly within national borders where state officials have authority significantly it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of indonesias leaders ability  or even desire perhaps  to use their capacity for statesanctioned violence other countries  including australia  have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another this propensity for the application of statesanctioned violence seems especially germane when we consider another president about whom great things were expected but who has inevitably disappointed after the unilateralism of george w bush barack obama was widely predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would not make the sort of catastrophic strategic miscalculations of his predecessor paradoxically enough though while obama has been widely criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit more american forces to the middle east this has done nothing to curb the use of statesanctioned violence on the contrary the use of drone strikes has become a key part of americas continuing war on terror it is unsurprising perhaps that a cerebral and reflective leader as obama is should be attracted to drones as a weapon of choice unlike jokowi obama doesnt have to confront the personal narratives of the people who die at his command or he doesnt unless theyre american citizens at least the recent death of an american hostage during a recent drone strike highlights the potential for collateral damage are these cases comparable yes and no widodos executions were coldblooded unnecessary and highly political obama clearly was not intending to kill americans and this has only become an issue because one of the hostages actually was however dozens of entirely innocent women and children from other countries are routinely killed in such strikes with little comment the key point is that we are collectively responsible for such deaths at some level or another especially if our leaders and state officials carry them out do good intentions justify one death and not another perhaps would we encourage the state to kill a thousand innocents if it meant eliminating hitler almost certainly would we authorize a drone strike to kill isis leader abu bakr albaghdad if we thought a couple of passersby might die too perhaps would we permit the state to execute people not any longer in australia at least but before we congratulate ourselves on how civilized and humane weve become perhaps we should pause to consider the violence that is still being inflicted on perfectly innocent people around the world in our collective name what was done in the name of the indonesian state was undoubtedly awful futile and reprehensible whether our moral calculus is quite so selfevidently superior is not quite so clear copyright 2015 the conversation some rights reserved",

        "article": "cnn theres an old saying which states the cape verde islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world in truth such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove but there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend the important and proud relationship the atlantic island country of just 500000 people has with music situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of africa cape verde has long been a mesh of cultures history and races the former portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled jews from this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque morna funana and other distinct musical styles now cape verde is seeking to tapinto the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish bereft of oil gas gold diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other african countries cape verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development and whats more alternative than a jiving swinging musical economy besides fish it is pretty common for cape verde to say our biggest richness is in music and culture said christine semba of womex an international networking platform for the world music genre the economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by cape verdes prime minister jose maria neves while the countrys ministry of culture is run by mario lucio de sousa himself a popular musician the future of our country lies in our capacity to create our capacity to innovate neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a world trade organization conference in 2013 other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts fashion and visual arts to name but a few however a 2013 report from the un conference on trade and development noted that cape verdes creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning but that doesnt mean there hasnt been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future one early musical success has been the kriol jazz festival the event which is celebrating its seventh edition took place in the capital city of praia this past weekend artists including grammywinning us singer esperanza spalding have been invited to perform as have acts from the likes of luxembourg brazil and of course cape verde according to harold taveres a liaison to the mayor of praia involved with promoting the festival kjf has become one of the most spectacular events in cape verde we breathe the music in cape verde we live with the music he added now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world to share in this during the festival bars hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as the week of party its a lucrative trade for sure yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the countrys ministry of culture alongside some enterprising private sector figures thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required enter the atlantic music expo a threeyearold conference and networking event that seeks to help cape verdean artists secure international exposure this years ame took place in the days before the kriol jazz festival delegates local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business we try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from cape verde said jose da silva long time manager of the late cape verdean songstress cesaria evora da silva is one of the driving forces behind ame as well as being the founder of the lusafrica and harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from cape verde he hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and toplevel musicians they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of cape verde across the globe not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require but it will garner valuable attention for the country this is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie tourism is expected to account for 20 of the countrys gdp by 2024 according to research from the world travel and tourism council getting cape verdes name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important economically its beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big da silva said this way it costs less money semba agrees with this and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like da silva for special praise in the long term the whole country is behind this event semba said adding this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries it must be noted however that few countries have the same natural resources for music as cape verde more from marketplace africa ",

        "article": "cnn when melissa atkins wardy author of redefining girly and a passionate advocate for fighting gender stereotypes heard from a frustrated mom on facebook she knew she needed to do something so she shared the moms story in a blog post wardy told how the mom veronica of richland washington wanted to buy big hero 6 fabric to make pillows for her two children the problem the fabric didnt include two of the heroes from the movie the female characters honey lemon and gogo so veronica decided to send an email to springs creative the company that makes the fabric saying that as a woman and an engineer she was offended she got an answer from the company but it didnt help girl empowerment ads like goldieblox do they work a licensing manager for springs creative responded that the company has found that boys dont want girl characters on their things eeeww girls yuck haha the licensing manager wrote it will come as no surprise that veronica was none too pleased to receive that response i was frustrated and disgusted that a manager and a female manager too would laugh off my initial contact with the company it was unprofessional so i responded veronica told cnn she asked that we not use her last name in order to maintain her privacy in an email back to the company veronica wrote by eliminating the women in your fabric design you are telling boys that its ok to think girls are yucky unworthy and less than a boy you are also telling girls they are unworthy unwanted and that its uncool to be smart and confident what happened next shows that parents aided by social media outrage may have more leverage to combat gender stereotyping in our culture than they realize and the big hero 6 example  along with a similar recent one involving toms the shoes retailer  suggests that manufacturers may be finally getting it too first the rest of the story about springs creative and the big hero fabric after sharing veronicas story with her readers and her 6700 twitter followers wardy encouraged people to give springs creative a piece of their mind she also invited them to tweet their own stories with the hashtag includethegirls women responded in droves pointing out how black widow the female character in the popular avengers superhero movie franchise is often excluded from merchandise and how cereal boxes rarely include female characters this sends the direct message to both boys and girls that females are forgettable unimportant undesirable what a horrible thing to teach our children said wardy who is also the founder and chief executive officer of pigtail pals  ballcap buddies a company that makes empowering clothing for boys and girls the prevailing theory is 1 boys are the default audience and 2 boys wont want an item with a girl on it wardy said yet i talk with thousands of parents every week who say otherwise why trying to make our kids happy can backfire  those parents are clearly making their voices heard because not too long after veronica received her initial response from springs creative wardy said she got a call from the company asking her to post a statement from springs creative on her site it is sometimes difficult to hear negative feedback but the message was clear and we intend to act upon your message the statement read most importantly springs creative does not condone sexism in any shape or form and does not design products to shine a negative light on females or males the company said it would be talking with disney immediately about additional designs for big hero 6 that would incorporate all the characters we would never intentionally offend any segment of the population we are a strong company with positive morals and values and we respect and see both genders equally said the statement springs creative told cnn it would have no further comment veronica said she was surprised the company responded so quickly i do not believe this would have happened without the pigtail pals and ballcap buddies community also raising their voices the real march madness when will womens teams get equal buzz around the same time wardy heard from another follower about an issue with toms and wrote about it on her site on the normally progressive retailers web landing page for kids were photos that some parents felt played into gender stereotypes one photo suggested playtime approved shoes for boys and the other this one on a pink background included the caption little ladies adorn their feet for spring really toms girls are not ornaments we adorn girls play too wardy wrote on her facebook page two hours later wardy received a comment from toms on her facebook page saying that the company completely agrees and that the wording has been changed to now say new arrivals for kids were really grateful whenever our community brings something like this to our attention said doug piwinski senior vice president global marketing and communications for toms perhaps as much or more than any other brand i mean we really listen to our customers in our community so heres my question are the two speedy responses from companies after women spoke out on social media more a sign that companies are truly getting it about gender stereotypes and girl and boy empowerment or more a sign of the power of parents or are they a mixture of both how to super bowl likeagirl  wardy said theres no doubt that companies are in business to protect their bottom line and that will always be a motivator but she said these backtoback incidents show what can happen when parents make it clear they wont buy products from companies that sell gender stereotypes  be not silent is my mantra speak up wardy said the success with springs creative and toms and other wins weve had in the past is an example of the power of parents moms and dads and childrens advocates aggregating their voices to say enough is enough  veronica said its a sign of the power of parents becoming more aware reactive and using social media to make their voices heard by companies that market to children she added one voice can be dismissed the hailstorm of voices collectively cannot be ignored so easily it is clear from these two examples that parents using their voices online and with their wallets can encourage companies to change theres no question that raising awareness about stereotypes helps said wardy if companies arent paying attention by now they most certainly should be pink princessy and sexy too soon  do you think more companies are getting the message to include girl characters on merchandise share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook",

next day would be like as a coowner of charmingtons a cafe in the intersection of three major baltimore neighborhoods rothschild knew that the cafe and its workers needed to support the city after all the unrest there was some fear but it was really mixed in with an overwhelming sense that everyone here needs help she said as protests erupt nationwide after the death of freddie gray a black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody some local businesses in baltimore are banding together to show their support for the city while others are left to rebuild or repair after mondays riot late monday evening over email rothschild  and other workers from charmingtons decided that the cafe would remain closed on tuesday so that staff members could spend the day in the community to help clean up or peacefully protest 45 cvs workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores  the following morning they posted a sign on the door telling patrons they were closed to partake in community action the cafe was not in mondays protest zone we shut down not out of fear but for solidarity rothschild said it was solidarity for baltimore for the black lives matter movement and for the local businesses that were destroyed during the rioting the fiveyear baltimore resident explained with a warm steaming crock pot of chicken and a cooler of ice water charmingtons staff member mike dobson made his way down to the center of the rallying tuesday and set up a stand it was one of a handful of businesses passing out free food and water to protesters the movement in baltimore is personal for dobson the 23yearold has been out on the streets peacefully demonstrating and offering free food every day since protests first started i have witnessed police brutality i was roughed up by police before it is something you dont have to look very far to witness in west baltimore he said the decision for charmingtons to close temporarily  it has since reopened  was meaningful dobson said our shop has been a part of the community since it opened and we thought it was important to be a part of the community especially now the feeling on baltimores streets has changed dramatically over the past few days its now peaceful and somewhat celebratory dobson said there have been protests but there have also been celebrations of all us together and you cant have a celebration without food he said not all businesses fared well some suffered major losses trevira londons store london couture boutique on fleet street was ransacked monday her windows were smashed and her merchandised looted they wiped me out the 36yearold said she understands the frustration and can see why some local businesses are joining the movement to stand with their city but shes also depressed that her business one that she opened only four months ago was destroyed in the wake of the unrest and there are reports that the weeklong curfew is affecting smaller businesses this is not a black or white issue this has been going on decades but there are ways to protest without hurting people destroying buildings and looting london said in the meantime she is thinking about boarding up her storefront just to be safe other businesses outside the major protest zones stayed open to be a resource for the community this past week john duda an owner and worker at the cooperative restaurant and bookstore red emmas decided to stay open after the upheaval on monday when  workers heard that schools were going to be closed tuesday they felt the need to keep their door opens in order to provide free meals to students and those who are the most vulnerable in the city we saw it on social media that people were trying to figure out how to feed school children who depend on school lunches and we thought we could stand in solidarity with folks the 37yearold said the response was incredible he said not only were students coming in for free lunches but baltimore residents were coming by to see whether they could volunteer and offer their support i was initially a little concerned that the reaction and the unrest on monday would take away from important issues facing the city duda said but he has seen residents of the city step up to show their support for not only freddie gray but the need to address social and economic disparities in the city it has inspired the 12year baltimore resident and business owner to start peacefully protesting as well on wednesday with the sun setting in the background duda marched with a group down the streets of baltimore the scene was beautiful duda said red emmas is normally closed during the 10 pm to 5 am curfew with the exception of having to close an hour early this friday and saturday charmingtons is not normally open during the curfew hours duda said many of the people marching werent just marching for freddie gray they were also marching for better education and work opportunities duda said these people have been voicing their frustrations for years but it seems like now they are finally being heard it took the city to almost tear itself apart for it to start coming together",

        "article": "cnn relations between iran and saudi arabia have always been thorny but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today tehran and riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the middle east in its most recent incarnation the iraniansaudi conflict by proxy has reached yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic for riyadh and its regional allies the saudi military intervention in yemen  operation decisive storm  is the moment the sunni arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of shiairanian influence for tehran and its regional allies  including the houthi movement in yemen  saudi arabias actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war when iranian president hassan rouhani was elected in june 2013 he pledged to reach out to riyadh he was up front and called tehrans steep deterioration of relations with the saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on iranian foreign policy from lebanon and afghanistan to pakistan and the gaza strip the iraniansaudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly and yet despite rouhanis open pledge profound differences over syria and iraq in particular have kept riyadh and tehran apart but if the questions of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostilities the saudi military intervention in yemen since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels unlike in syria and in iraq the saudi military is now directly battling it out with iranianbacked rebels in yemen while riyadh no doubt exaggerates tehrans role in the yemen crisis its fingerprints are nonetheless evident iran provides financial support weapons training and intelligence to houthis gerald feierstein a us state department official and former yemen ambassador told a congressional hearing last week we believe that iran sees opportunities with the houthis to expand its influence in yemen and threaten saudi and gulf arab interests the iranians find the charges biased and point to the saudi airstrikes in yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbors affairs in iran the cue came from the countrys top authority supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who has been unusually blunt he tweeted despite disputes the saudis used to display composure with us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power  replaced composure with barbarism three days after khameneis speech iran suspended religious pilgrimages to mecca this came as news broke about two iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting saudi arabia meanwhile antisaudi protests have been staged in a number of iranian cities khameneis speech opened the floodgate of antisaudi statements the voices of hardline figures in tehran have been the most agitated general ahmad purdastan the commander of the iranian ground forces taunted the saudis beware of the day when firecrackers explode in riyadh purdastan said in a notsosubtle warning but it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the saudis ayatollah aliakbar hashemi rafsanjani a former president and arguably irans most vocal advocate of better iraniansaudi relations called riyadhs military intervention a strategic mistake and urged for a political solution seeking a political solution is irans stated aim for the yemeni crisis but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim iranian foreign minister javad zarif has provided a fourpoint plan to get a ceasefire to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid to promote political dialogue among warring yemeni parties and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government but the iranian proposal also asks for an end to saudi airstrikes as zarif put it iran and saudi arabia need to talk but we cannot talk to determine the future of yemen the saudis have thus far ignored the iranian proposal meanwhile the houthi leadership has welcomed the plan as one of its leaders said in irans plan unacceptable solutions do not exist not only do the saudis not have any faith in any iraniandrafted political package that is welcomed by the houthis but riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it saudi arabia was elated by the un security council vote on 14 april that condemned the houthi movement only russia abstained but a solution to the yemeni crisis will not come from the un the un can provide a cover for riyadhs military intervention but it cannot secure it a military win this leaves riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in yemen saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the houthi movement and it allies in the yemeni armed forces it requires ground troops on a huge scale riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco the pakistanis most famously turned down the saudi request and let it be known that yemen is a quagmire they can do without instead islamabad has asked iran to push the houthis for a political compromise that riyadh can live with the turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the houthis  but in his visit to tehran last week turkish president recep tayyip erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized iranianturkish trade relations over rivalry in yemen and emphasized a political solution for the yemeni conflict the egyptians and the jordanians are still supportive of saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist riyadh in yemen but whether they will go through with it is another matter egypt has a long list of problems of its own including a bloody counterterrorism campaign in sinai that it cannot afford to lose but also an eastern border with lawless libya that is increasingly a new front in cairos fight against jihadists it is hard to see how egyptian general abdel fattah elsisi can commit troops to a yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to egypts security the same kind of domestic realities including the threat from isis will also prevent jordan from any significant contribution to saudi military efforts in yemen these hard realities leave riyadh with two options it can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same houthis that riyadh is attacking today alternatively given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops riyadh will have to contemplate a fullscale invasion of yemen that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate the iranians too are faced with stark choices it is beyond tehrans ability to tame the yemeni crisis as tempting as it might be for tehran to see the saudis bleed in yemen the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the middle east will undermine broader regional iranian interests a political compromise that both riyadh and tehran and their respective yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic",

became a spiritual leader and celebrity icon with a long list of famous followers and friends but now the bikram brand is in jeopardy with some yoga studios dropping his name after the guru was accused of rape or sexual assault by six of his former students responding to the allegations for the first time in an exclusive interview with cnn choudhury said he wanted to set the record straight i want to show you he said tell the truth to the world that i never assaulted them choudhury repeatedly denied sexually assaulting anyone saying he would never resort to physical aggression to have sex because he has so many offers women like me women love me he said so if i really wanted to involve the women i dont have to assault the women he said he feels sorry for his accusers claiming theyve been manipulated by lawyers to lie i have nothing against them i dont think theyre bad people its not them saying that he said they are influenced by somebody but choudhurys accusers say hes the one whos been lying this stuff that hes teaching is really good stuff but hes hurting people and hiding behind this good stuff so people dont believe hes capable of hurting people said sarah baughn a former student who now accuses choudhury of sexual assault hes got to stop lying behind it and hes got to stop doing this to people choudhury is the founder of bikrams yoga college of india hes featured prominently on its website which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room with studios heated to 105 degrees he credits the steamy sweaty stretches with transforming peoples bodies and minds he said hes guided by a deep calling to help others civil lawsuits filed in los angeles superior court tell the story of a different bikram choudhury describing him as someone who preyed on young women who looked to him for guidance besides baughns claim of sexual assault five other women have come forward with civil lawsuits claiming choudhury raped them the los angeles police department without explanation declined to pursue criminal charges in the cases at first baughn said she felt bikram yoga would be the answer to her years of back pain and depression it was really quite lifechanging for me  i felt good for the first time in a while she said describing her first class baughn said her father helped her take out a 7000 loan so she could attend bikrams teacher training but within the first week she said one episode left her feeling uncomfortable in a meeting in choudhurys office she said the guru seemed to make an advance he said what should we do about us we need to make this a relationship  ive known you from a past life it was instantly shocking i felt like my whole system just sort of imploded she said then she said choudhury cornered her late one night making it clear she had to sleep with him in order to advance her career he crawled on top of me and he put his hand on my inside of my thigh and the other hand he wrapped around me and he was holding me there she said he told me that he needed somebody to be with him to massage him to brush his hair to spend time with him that he was lonely and he said and i need someone to to have sex with me choudhury she said claimed shed never win a yoga competition if he didnt have sex with her i pushed him off of me and i said i can do this by myself and he said no you cant theres no way and i got up and i left the room she said in another instance she said choudhury pinned her against a door and sexually assaulted her when she was left alone with him late one night at a teacher training course i just remember i was terrified i didnt want to be touched again when i reached the door he was there she said he was only in his boxers and a tshirt and he pushed himself up against me and held me up against the door she said and he just started kissing all over my chest and my body and he pushed himself into me very hard ultimately baughn said she was able to open the door and get away choudhury said baughns claims are false its not truth i dont do that i dont have to he said he said he makes it a practice to never be alone with any of his students he repeatedly denied assaulting his accusers or ever having consensual sex with them but when asked whether hed had sex with other students he responded yes and no i have no intention to have sex with any of my students or any women said choudhury who said hes been married to his wife for more than 30 years sometimes students they commit suicide lots of students of mine they commit suicide because i will not have sex with them bikram claimed these encounters took place before he was married  but when asked for evidence bikrams attorney advised him not to give cnn names robert tafoya choudhurys attorney said there are plenty of reasons to doubt the accusers claims we know for a fact that these claims allegedly occurred years and years and years ago and nobody ever came forward he said and yet after this lawyer sends out these kinds of blasts in social media asking people if theyve been a victim of bikram choudhury all of a sudden these people come forward and all have very similar claims carney shegerian baughns attorney said thats simply not true when baughn started telling her story he said others were inspired to speak out when she came forward and went public it attracted other people and the other five plaintiffs to also have a modicum of confidence to discuss what had happened to them he said baughn said she was inspired by her young daughter to come forward when she did shes 5 now 5\u00bd but when i looked at my little girl and all i could see was 10 years down the road or 20 years down the road and her being just like me the only thing i could see was her getting raped and assaulted she said choudhury vowed to clear his name but he said the damage has already been done to his family he cries as he describes how his wife has responded to the allegations against him my wife never look at me anymore he said my children my wife  we only die once in our life im dying every day when i get up in the morning the situation he said has destroyed his family how can i share my heart my spirit twentyfour hours a day i work harder than any other human being and this is the reward im a rapist he said shame on your culture western culture shame shame your job

        "article": "cnn authorities in south carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of walter scott but the footage does not show the actual shooting video from the patrol car of north charlestons michael slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and scott slager approaches scotts vehicle the two men speak scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle slager then returns to his patrol car scott exits his vehicle briefly and slager tells him to stay in the car scott then gets out of the car again and runs away out of the range of the dash cam the video which was released thursday also shows a passenger in scotts car the passengers identity was not given in a police report obtained by cnn but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle scott family attorney chris stewart told cnn the man with scott was a coworker and friend he did not identify the friend by name when asked what might have motivated scott to run justin bamberg another attorney for the family speculated that scott might have been concerned about child support issues scott owed back payments on child support totaling 1810443 according to charleston county family court documents obtained by cnn he had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by slager but bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened this dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed mr scott  that shooting was completely unjustified and that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit the lawyer said the north charleston police department is not providing more information citing an ongoing investigation of scotts killing thats being conducted by the independent south carolina law enforcement division sled many questions remain about what happened on saturday when officer slager pulled scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight in the police report that cnn obtained a responding officer said that slager said that at one point he started to chase scott down a street shots fired and the subject is down the officer writes that slager said he took my taser but a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw scott try to get slagers taser feidin santana was walking to work when he saw slager and scott struggle on the ground he told nbcs lester holt on wednesday santana then took out his phone and started recording video i remember the police officer had control of the situation he had control of scott santana said then santana said he heard the sound of a taser it seemed to santana that scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the tasered again on thursday a second witness spoke to cnn about what she saw gwen nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and curious she followed them she saw scott and slager at the entrance to a vacant lot it was like a tussle type of thing like you know like what do you want or what did i do type of thing said nichols who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw i didnt hear mr slager saying stop  she said feidin showed the video to the scott family but santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape in interviews with msnbc and nbc santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video i  thought about erasing the video santana told msnbcs all in with chris hayes in an interview that aired wednesday evening i felt that my life with this information might be in danger the video shows slager shooting eight times at scott as scott runs away witness i nearly erased shooting video out of fear  an autopsy showed that scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body before the officer starts firing his gun in the video a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground its not clear whether that is the taser later in the video when the officer approaches scotts body he drops a dark object next to the man its also not clear whether that is the taser its unknown whether scott took the officers taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body slager has been fired and charged with murder he is white scott who was unarmed was black timeline of events  scotts shooting stirred memories of the michael brown case in ferguson missouri where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer a grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case but not everyone agreed that scotts case is like browns or that race was a factor asked how he felt about slager being charged with murder santana answered that no one can feel happy he has his family and mr scott also has his family he told holt but i think you know he made a bad decision  mr scott didnt deserve this and there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested and that wasnt the proper way to do that lessons learned from ferguson to north charleston  the fbi is investigating as is sled i have watched the video and i was sickened by what i saw north charleston police chief eddie driggers told reporters wednesday mayor keith summey spoke at the same news conference which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted no justice no peace they called for the mayor to step down summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras so every officer on the street in the city will have one that is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered he said just before the conference was set to

white the makeup of the citys police department is unclear though its been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 black three of 10 city council members are black its unclear what slagers motivation was or if race played a part in scotts slaying we cant get into the brain of another individual so we cant state that scott family attorney stewart said i think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature if convicted slager could face life in prison or the death penalty who is officer slager an autopsy of scott showed that he sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and his death was the result of a homicide the charleston county coroners office said asked whether cpr was performed on scott after slager shot him driggers said in the end of it the video what i saw was what i believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of lifesaving procedure but im not sure what took place there when scotts brother anthony saw the video he was convinced slagers account of what happened was not true he told cnn there was not a struggle for the taser anthony scott said i didnt believe my brother would have done that anyway to  anthony scott the videotape shows his brother was running for his life away from the officer i think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot no one would have thought that scott said family members have adamantly repeated that they dont want protests over scotts slaying to become violent and so far the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful scotts mother judy scott told cnns anderson cooper that she feels forgiveness in my heart even for the guy that shot and killed my son he was a loving son a loving father she said he cared about his family and  no matter what happens it will not replace my son who was walter scott cnns tony marco ryan scallan christine bear tristan smith martin

        "article": "cnn my name is mark goodacre and i am a professor of new testament and christian origins in the department of religious studies at duke university i was series adviser and one of many oncamera experts on cnns finding jesus i also appeared in each episode of the program viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the finding jesus facebook page during the season finale about mary magdalene below are some of the most interesting and my answers to them they have been edited for style and clarity for this article  anarie kennedy the copy we have of the gospel of mary magdalene comes from the second century but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older like first century goodacre actually the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century it is currently located in berlin germany although its our most complete manuscript it is missing several pages there are two other fragments of the gospel of mary both in greek and both dating from the third century it is difficult to date the gospel itself one of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century gustavo odr\u00eda  where can we get a good translation of the gospel of mary magdalene goodacre there are several good translations of the gospel of mary one suggestion is karen kings the gospel of mary of magdala jesus and the first woman apostle that book also has good introduction and discussion materials one thing that is worth adding is that the gospel is not actually called the gospel of mary magdalene the term magdalene does not come at all in the texts we have of the gospel the heroine is simply called mary edward james reeves i would like to know what really happened to mary magdalene where did she go who last saw her goodacre this is one of the great mysteries about the character she is so prominent at the end of each of the canonical gospels and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the new testament but there is nothing she is not mentioned in acts of the apostles or in pauls letters or anywhere else one possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle but if that is the case it is surprising that the gospel writers pay so much attention to her in their passion and resurrection narratives another possibility and we touched on this in the episode is that mary died not long after the events narrated in the gospels perhaps she was a wealthy elderly widow turnbullteacher wouldnt church fathers writing in the second century have written if jesus was married or not goodacre thats a good question there is actually nothing in second century writers that says that jesus was married and clement of alexandria died 215 ad takes for granted that jesus was not married when the gospel of jesus wife was published in 2012 it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of jesus being married from as early as the second century but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery anna585858 do you think magdalene is a nickname or reference to marys hometown goodacre its a good guess that magdalene refers to magdala and so her name would refer to her hometown just as jesus the nazarene is from nazareth there are other characters in the new testament who are identified by their hometowns for example simon of cyrene and joseph of arimathea you are right though that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with magdala allsaintsradio why was the gospel of mary magdalene left out of the canon of 66 biblical books goodacre this is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention the gospel of mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early christian works but in any case the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with matthew mark luke and john all of which are written by the end of the first or at the latest the beginning of the second century further the gospel of marys theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical gospels stephanoledreed where is it said that jesus had a wife goodacre there are no ancient texts in which jesus had a wife the closest we get to the idea is the gospel of philip in which mary magdalene is described as jesus companion one of three women who always walked with the lord the same gospel says that jesus used to kiss her often but we dont know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point however the gospel of philip is probably too late late second to midthird century to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical mary magdalene funding jesus who bankrolled christs ministry i would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks sorry that fellow oncamera expert candida moss and i could not get to all of them thanks too for all the encouraging words about finding jesus we are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it if you would like to explore these issues in more detail perhaps i might recommend my podcast the nt pod which you can find on itunes or at httppodacreblogspotcom",

        "article": "cnn the powers of marvels allstar superheroes go a bit wobbly in avengers age of ultron faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012s the avengers the third highestgrossing film of all time writerdirector joss whedon mixes some brooding downtime in with the abundant spectacle to be sure series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex less rote ways so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2 already scheduled for release in may of 2018 and 2019 respectively not that any of this will matter much since the pentup excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summers presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the onebillion dollar threshold internationally handson producer kevin feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in hollywood history a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the avengers so while sideline enterprises like the new daredevil tv series continue to pop up the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining biggun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade at this point no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end and comiccon can plan its main events years ahead in the meantime the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the hardestcore geeks last summer guardians of the galaxy showed that marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does but the bigname franchises still seem sacrosanct and so it is with avengers age of ultron which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different picking up where last years captain america winter soldier left off the new film without preamble dives right in to show the avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty hydra organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries twins pietro and wanda aarontaylor

handsome he makes an excellent intellectual and smartass sparring partner for stark but when he first appears hes still on training wheels however he does recruit pietro and wanda to his cause an easy matter since stark killed their parents hes not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but in their first skirmish with him the avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying could star wars open at 500 million licking their wounds at the safe house of hawkeyes farm the avengers go into a funk the impatient thor quickly takes off to find answers bruce resists natashas desire to get

america heads for seoul where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called the cradle which will hatch massproduced android soldiers that will pave the way for ultrons world domination but a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity of course the avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of buttkicking theyre supposed to do and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called vision redfaced and greengarbed vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by paul bettany heretofore limited in the marvel world to vocal work as starks computerized butler jarvis and it can be hoped if not assumed that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two avengers installments galaxy quest tv series in the works  ultimately whedons efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability comes off as halfbaked as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material after all these are comic book characters defined by their double identities a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired if ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired the elements were there for the taking including a semitragic component along with mystery about ultrons ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters but then what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured avengers age of ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do but this time the action scenes dont always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic nomansland the returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner while series newcomer andy serkis has a terrific couple of

360 baltimore mayor stephanie rawlingsblake said she understands where the protesters are coming from she understands their frustration mr grays family deserves justice and our community deserves an opportunity to heal to get better and to make sure that something like this doesnt happen again she said earlier in the day the baltimore police department released the names of six police officers suspended with pay they are lt brian rice 41 who joined the department in 1997 officer caesar goodson 45 who joined in 1999 sgt alicia white 30 who joined in 2010 officer william porter 25 who joined in 2012 officer garrett miller 26 who joined in 2012 and officer edward nero 29 who joined in 2012 after an incustody death it is standard procedure to release the names of officers involved said baltimore police department spokesman capt eric kowalczyk it doesnt mean the officers did anything wrong nor does it mean that these were the only officers involved he said of the six officers three were on bikes and initially approached gray another made eye contact with gray another officer joined in the arrest after it was initiated and one drove the police van kowalczyk said the autopsy hasnt yielded many answers in grays death  in fact its prompted more questions  but baltimores mayor pledged tuesday to find out how the 25yearold died after being arrested a week prior im going to make sure that as we get information that we can confirm were going to put that information out in the public mayor rawlingsblake said i want people to understand that i have no interest in hiding information holding back information shes angry she said and among the questions she wants answered are why did police stop gray in the first place and why did arresting officers make what she called the mistake of not immediately requesting medical attention when gray asked for iti  he was dragged a bit but then you see him using his legs to get into the van so he was ablebodied when he was in the van and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van he was unresponsive she said challenged on the ablebodied remark  video shows grays legs hanging listlessly as officers carry him by his shoulders  rawlingsblake said the medical examiner would make the final determination but we know he was fine getting into the van we will get to the bottom of it and we will go where the facts lead us she said we will hold people accountable if we find there was wrongdoing she further said she absolutely believes we need to have an outside investigation especially when baltimores dark history of police misconduct is considered police plan to conclude their investigation by friday may 1 from there the case will go to the states attorneys office which will decide whether to file charges the justice department has been watching developments in the gray case and is officially looking into whether a prosecutable civil rights violation occurred a spokesperson said tuesday in october the justice department announced a collaborative reform initiative with the baltimore police department to include an assessment of policies training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens police brutality not on rise coverage is  when law enforcement misconduct is uncovered the us department of justice has a variety of tools available to respond responses to misconduct in law enforcement organizations fall along a continuum of intervention with the specific response calibrated to address the particular circumstances of any given situation ronald davis director of the justice departments office of community oriented policing services said in a statement at the time the justice department began the datagathering stage of the lengthy process in january and held its first public town hall last week at coppin state university it was attended by hundreds of residents many of whom sounded off about their experiences with baltimore police right now we are past the stage of implementing policies and procedures this is a state of emergency right now tawanda jones told justice department officials according to cnn affiliate wbal jones brother tyrone west died in police custody in 2013 the mayor issued a statement ahead of the town hall saying that 230 officers accused of misconduct between january 2012 and february 2015 had accepted punishment outright while another 61 officers were found guilty through trial board hearings bpd is the nations eighthlargest police force with almost 4000 civilian and sworn personnel i am determined to not allow a small handful of bad actors tarnish the reputation of the overwhelming majority of police officers putting their lives in danger to make baltimore a safer city rawlingsblake said in the statement the mayor had asked the justice department to take a look at the police department the baltimore sun reported saying that her request came on the heels of the newspapers report that the city had paid almost 6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011 overwhelmingly the sun reported the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges under rawlingsblakes watch she said the city has seen a decline in lawsuits as well as reports of excessive force and discourtesy i went to annapolis for tougher laws to hold cops accountable im fighting to bring back the trust between the police and the community she said according to documents obtained monday the april 12 incident began when gray ran from police while the court documents allege that one of the arresting officers garrett miller took gray into custody after finding a switchblade in his pocket the gray family attorney called the allegation a sideshow gray was carrying a pocket knife of legal size attorney william murphy said police never saw the knife and chased gray only after he took off running the attorney said court documents said gray fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence the officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of grays front right pants pocket the defendant was arrested without force or incident the documents say the knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted onehandoperated knife the mayor has questioned whether police should have pursued gray in the first place it is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone so we still have questions rawlingsblake said gray was in perfect health until police chased and tackled him murphy said less than an hour later he was on his way to a trauma clinic with a spinal injury where he fell into a coma the family has not seen the autopsy report yet murphy said and relatives are still waiting to take possession of grays body the family intends to have a second private autopsy conducted once baltimore police turn over the body the attorney said police according to their own timeline spotted gray gave chase caught him cuffed him and requested a paddy wagon in fewer than four minutes the transport van left with gray about 11 minutes after that police said and another 30 minutes passed before units request paramedics to the western district to transport the suspect to an area hospital when cell phones began recording gray was already on the ground with three officers kneeling over him he let out long screams officers had encountered him a minute earlier in an area where drug deals and crime are common deputy police commissioner rodriguez said gray has an extensive criminal history which appears to be mostly drugrelated the officers called for a prisoner transport van cell phone video taken from two positions showed officers lifting gray whose hands were cuffed by his shoulders and dragging him to the back of the van officers put more restraints on gray inside the van police said while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking that was at 854 amb  at 924 am police called an ambulance to pick gray up murphy and angry residents of baltimore want to know what happened in those 30 minutes in between police said gray requested medical attention including an inhaler and an ambulance later took him to the university of maryland medical centers shock trauma center he lapsed into a coma died was resuscitated stayed in a coma and on monday underwent extensive surgery at shock trauma to save his life murphy said he clung to life for seven days what we know and dont know about grays death  cnns suzanne malveaux shawn nottingham anneclaire stapleton julian cummings

that kept him busy after leaving school at 15 these days his mara group spans over 20 countries and hes been called africas youngest billionaire in late 2013 thakkar joined forces with the former boss of barclays bank  bob diamond  to start an investment fund focused on africa called atlas mara the powerful duo raised 325 million through a share flotation  well above the 250 million target but his vision spans beyond africa and earth  thakkar was the first african to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with richard bransons company virgin galactic cnns marketplace africa spoke to thakkar about african innovation entrepreneurship and collaboration an edited version of the interview follows cnn  you are active in several african countries how is the current business landscape on the continent ashish thakkar right now in the last 18 years i have been active on the continent i have never seen so much global excitement around africa that ive seen today the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved unfortunately its one of those cases where perception is so different from reality the reality on the ground is so much better than the perception youve got to remember as africa we are 54 countries some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit cnn why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the african continent at we have a very young demographic  85 of our populations are under the age of 35 we have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture yet entrepreneurship is not in the education system where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance and its something frankly that i am extremely passionate about because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants etc its going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises so its great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system and innovation is totally embedded into that cnn what is it about africa that encourages innovation at the biggest advantage we have at the moment and youve seen this with mobile phone penetration is that we dont have legacy systems we didnt have landlines and we didnt need them we didnt have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere we leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony today we have over 750 million phones on the continent  more than north america and western europe put together we can actually leapfrog in so many different ways mobile money is another brilliant example mobile money was created in kenya the whole concept of having money on your phone which is the best thing because its secure its practical made more sense so these kind of innovations youre going to see a lot more of on the continent i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that theyre coming up with is just so inspiring cnn what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur whos just starting out at entrepreneurship is a journey its not a destination there are going to be so many challenges you are going to get knocked down so many times but youve got to get up dust yourself off and get back to it the persistence the passion and staying on course is very crucial youll be tempted to cut corners youll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker but it never lasts people say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow  were not were the leaders of today but its our responsibility to take the seat at the table cnn what needs to be done most urgently to grow african economies at panafrican collaboration is extremely important i think things like regional integration interafrican trade does need to increase and is increasing i mean the progress in the east african community has been amazing the manner in which theyve harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic so we need to see more of that take place on the continent the fact that were 54 countries yet were a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage i think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial cnn are you confident about the future of the continent at i am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership the mindset of our leaders it is so inspiring to see that its unfortunate that you know globally the highlight remains things like ebolathe little issues that we do have are just magnified yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing cnn is this africas century at maras logo is the african lion and our little joke which a lot of people dont appreciate hence i love it even more is that the indian tiger and the chinese dragon have had their days and its now the african lions turn and it genuinely is  this is our turn more from marketplace africa  read this africas green lean speed machines  read this family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise  editors note cnn marketplace africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continents key industries and corporations ",

        "article": "phoenix arizona cnn nearly 12 million parents in the united states currently are raising kids on their own when single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle jody farleyberens saw the need firsthand when her childhood friend faced that situation making ends meet is insurmountable said farleyberens there are so many doctors appointments copays surgeries prescriptions  and then the inability to work  any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly she did all she could to help  after her friend passed away farleyberens helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances since 2006 singleton moms has provided practical financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the phoenix area do you know a hero nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015  tiffany montgomery 48 was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage4 breast cancer farleyberens group pitched in to help so montgomery could spend more time with her daughter ezri now 10 when you cant really do much and youre looking at the dirt on the floor its one more level of stress she said  you have these people that come in that dont know you and youre going to help me with cleaning my house singleton moms has actually changed my whole outlook they care about you and theyre demonstrating their love through their actions i sat down with farleyberens to ask her about her work below is an edited version of our conversation cnn tell me about the woman who inspired your work farleyberens  i grew up with a girl named michelle singleton who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30  she was a single mother of four children and i was a young mom with two kids and it was scary you just want to be there to watch them grow up paying the bills cleaning her home making dinner for her kids  all of that became a real struggle i wanted to make things as easy as possible for her so when i would go to the store id grab an extra tide and extra toilet paper when i would make my meals for my family i would double it and bring a meal over to her house  once i helped with an electric bill  i just tried to do those little things that i hoped would relieve her of some stress about six months after she passed we got to thinking she couldnt have been the only one there were other people like her that needed help  and thats how singleton moms was born cnn id imagine that many people havent thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer  how are you able to help farleyberens we focus on daytoday support  financial assistance housecleaning prepared meals supplies for the home kids events its that oldfashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors who doesnt like a clean house that they didnt have to clean themselves we have a team of volunteers that have all been backgroundchecked and they sweep mop clean the bathrooms we even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes and so our parents can come home from chemo sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about ugh the bathroom needs to be cleaned  its just to allow them to focus on whats important which is their health and their family cnn is this work hard for you sometimes on a personal level farleyberens about 80 of the parents we support are stage 4 which means that battling cancer is their fulltime job they will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives theyll be in treatment its hard  its a rollercoaster  ive had bouts when a certain mom has passed where i didnt get out of bed for two weeks and i thought why am i doing this  but then i come back and remember why and so while michelle is and always will be our inspiration there are now so many others that are just as inspirational theyre why i keep doing what i do cnn we should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate farleyberens were not just about moms  we have dads too not a lot but if you are a single parent you need the support  they tend to even get a little special treatment  everybodys like oh theres a dad here  and so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them cnn  its such a serious subject but your group seems to have a very fun vibe farleyberens were very social  once a month all of our families come to pick up their supplies  we do crafts with the kids snacks and have a good time  we like having any event because cancer sucks and theres not a lot of happy that goes with that but life does still go on so its really important that these families can just destress and have fun no one can understand what theyre going through like another single parent with cancer so giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful cancer can be so defeating  its an ugly word and its a sad word  and so its my hope that singleton moms can bring joy and say to cancer you cant defeat us  we are still going to be strong and were going to celebrate life  and you cant take that away from us want to get involved check out the singleton moms website at wwwsingletonmomsorg and see how to help",

        "article": "cnn it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former nfl star aaron hernandez killed semipro player odin lloyd on monday hernandezs defense gave its side of the story wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day hernandez 25 is on trial for the shooting death of lloyd whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013 now that the defense has rested it wont be long before the jury begins deliberating much of the evidence in the former new england patriots case is circumstantial here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday  as news spread that hernandez was under investigation in june 2013 patriots owner robert kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after lloyds death he said he was not involved kraft testified last week he said he was innocent and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club theres only one potential problem with that claim the time lloyd was killed hadnt been made public yet by the time hernandez met with kraft so how could hernandez have known when lloyd was killed what a great great witness for the prosecution cnn legal analyst mel robbins said basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand when questioned by a defense attorney kraft said that hed never had any problems with hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him hernandezs fiancee shayanna jenkins revealed for the first time last week that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couples home that she said reeked of marijuana she also said she didnt know what was in the box that revelation may contradict the prosecutions contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered during crossexamination by the defense jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled skunky earlier she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didnt know what was in the box she said hernandez never told her and she never looked after concealing the box with her daughters clothing jenkins said she threw it away in a random dumpster but could not remember exactly where much testimony has focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows about 93000 pairs of that shoe were made significantly fewer in a size 13 the shoes sole makes a distinct impression said lt steven bennett of the massachusetts state police the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes  more than 3 million  make the same impression yet bennett who works in crime scene services testified that the footprint left near lloyds body was in agreement or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13 although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night he used an identical pair to make his determination bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison prosecutors used grainy footage from hernandezs home security system to suggest he was holding a 45caliber handgun  the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandezs home in my opinion the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol glock sales manager kyle aspinwall testified the video is timestamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks  the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving hernandezs lawyers then showed a different part of the video timestamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand suggesting it may be an ipad glock pistols dont have white glows to them do they defense attorney james sultan asked no they do not aspinwall answered sultan then displayed a softpellet gun similar in shape to a glock suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding hernandez has pleaded not guilty in lloyds death but already his arrest has led to deep consequences including his release from the new england patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings so what might make a young man who had signed a 40 million contract risk everything prosecutors have said lloyd might have done or said something that didnt sit well with hernandez they claimed hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score hernandezs codefendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately but the case gets more complicated evidence collected in lloyds death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub that double shooting took place in july 2012 almost a year before lloyd was killed prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing lloyd the spot where that double murder happened during trial prosecutors suggest a text written by hernandez the day before the murder saying he was buggin for showing lloyd the spot may have played a role in plotting to kill lloyd the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in lloyds trial ruling it is prejudicial hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well but when the lloyd trial ends that murder trial awaits him cnns jason hanna lawrence crook laura dolan and catherine e shoichet contributed to this report",

        "article": "cnn its a good thing  a lucky thing  that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer michael slager gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named walter scott after a traffic stop in north charleston south carolina and the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation  along with the prompt arrest of slager on murder charges  is a welcome and appropriate response but the event raises broad troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of a thirdparty recording its not supposed to be a mystery more than 20 years ago congress approved a law the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 signed by president bill clinton that requires the federal justice department to collect data on deaths caused by police the law has never truly been implemented leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in america what happened here today doesnt happen all the time what if there was no video what if there was no witness  or hero as i call him  to come forward said l chris stewart an attorney for scotts family as you can see the initial police reports stated something totally different thats putting it mildly in early police statements  issued before the video came to light  slager reportedly said that scott attacked him that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive scott the video makes hash of those claims and likely contributed to slagers swift arrest and pending murder charges when youre wrong youre wrong said north charleston mayor keith summey that leaves slager to face murder charges that could land him on death row  and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality im all for having police use body cameras although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force but the much bigger problem is that we simply dont know when and where police killings take place or whether they cluster in particular cities or states and that means we dont know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias we dont even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness these vital questions arent supposed to be a mystery according to section 210402 of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 the attorney general shall through appropriate means acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers  the attorney general shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section that section of the law has effectively been ignored beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in 1996 by 2001 a new york times article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force no comprehensive accounting for all of the nations 17000 police department exists there are multiple reasons the law has been ignored collecting information from the nations thousands of jurisdictions  the myriad villages counties and cities  is a tough expensive assignment the job is even harder because many police departments reluctant to air their dirty laundry fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that its up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality  something thats often established only after years of court proceedings these hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from washington but congress has failed to press the justice department to demand the data and comply with the 1994 law a weak substitute called the death in custody reporting act was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014 but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations  and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular mandatory enforcement of the datagathering law in 2011 the las vegas reviewjournal published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around las vegas and found 378 shootings over a 20year period 142 of which were fatal in no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an onduty shooting in south carolina last month the state newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects and found that only a handful of officers were charged and none found guilty in south carolina it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone the columbia newspaper concluded a group of activists has created a website called mappingpoliceviolenceorg that flags cases of police killings its estimate that at least 304 black people were killed by police in 2014 may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem but we shouldnt be guessing as the las vegas reviewjournal editorialized in 2011 how many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings how can they know about a potential local problem without information  police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute the budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule the social impact of such an addition however would be huge that commonsense observation is being echoed by the obama administration  specifically the presidents task force on 21st century policing created in december in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including michael brown and eric garner the recently released interim report of the task force calls one more time for the justice department to collect comprehensive data from local departments but it will take more pressure  from activists victims families members of congress and president barack obama himself  to demand an end to the stonewalling of information its long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like walter scotts are happening without a video to set the record straight",

        "article": "cnn its no surprise which image is making the headlines from this weeks gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in panama a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuban president raul castro but this first meeting of obama and castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story or at least obama is hoping it wont be after all the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments the reality is that the united states has been losing ground in this increasingly important region and obama needs to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the americas if the us is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends but who have drifted away as america has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the middle east unfortunately america has lost influence in latin america to a hyperactive china a cunning russia and a troubling iran all of which have made inroads in the region at washingtons expense this gathering therefore offers a chance for the us to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with latin american and caribbean blood who make their homes in the united states the foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there but they need attention and the panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building but first do no harm large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events and the us with its vast experience in preparing for highlevel multilateral meetings knows the importance of dotting the is and crossing the ts but this hasnt stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and pr disasters for the us just look at the last summit held in cartagena colombia which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after secret service agents embarrassed the united states by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms in violation of basic security protocols they were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee as a result of all this the americans looked dumb incompetent  and cheap and back in 2009 the president  new on the job  was caught flat footed by a fasttalking fiery antiamerican president of venezuela the late hugo chavez outplayed the leader of the free world who had just taken office and was trying to show americas new outstretched hand toward the foe of the george w bush era the summit hit a depressing low for the obama administration when chavez walked up to obama and as the cameras clicked handed the american president a copy of the book open veins of latin america which blames the regions woes on the us and europe yet the problems in cartagena werent just symbolic regional leaders lined up against washington which had refused to include cuba in the summit and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless havana was also invited america was cornered all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early clinton years when the president issued an invitation to democratically elected heads of state of latin america which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship back then the us had just led the creation of the north american free trade agreement nafta and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region namely democracy free trade and economic growth thats what it should aim for every time articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it can obama manage something similar this time true the president has come armed with his new cuba policy unfortunately in an effort to placate critics who say obama is not doing more for prodemocracy activists the white house has miscalculated with venezuela handing the repressive regime of chavezs successor nicolas maduro a stick with which to beat the us obama has long and rightly ignored maduros claims that the us planned to overthrow him but a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed maduro  who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country  a way to portray himself a victim of the us something he will no doubt play that up in panama all this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with latin americans who already have complicated feelings toward the us over its cold war support for unseemly rightwing dictators a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing sovietbacked communism from taking hold but those days are behind us today the people want prosperity they want democracy and they want the rule of law  all of which leave a potential opening for the united states too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms opposition leaders are in prison in venezuela a prosecutor who criticized the president was found dead in argentina press freedom is under siege in several countries and corruption is reaching new highs all of this suggests that if obama plays his cards right he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of latin america that their goals are also americas goals that like them he supports democracy human rights the rule of law full freedom of expression and free elections in every country the fact that he met with cuban dissidents was welcome and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with cuba for the millions in latin america that still live in poverty these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury but if obama can show them that the united states is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives then he will leave a longerlasting legacy in the region than just a handshake",

preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it i see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world who are diving in head first i see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be i see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday americans for the first time a majority 53 favor its legalization with 77 supporting it for medical purposes support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone in 1969 the first time pew asked the question about legalization only 12 of the nation was in favor i see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids school a police officer i met in michigan is part of the revolution as are the editors of the medical journal neurosurgery i see it in the faces of good parents uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children  and in the children themselves such as charlotte who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month we know it wont consistently have such dramatic results or any impact at all in others but what medicine does i see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places girls seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in georgia  among my colleagues my patients and my friends i have even seen the revolution in my own family a few years ago when i told my mother i was investigating the topic for a documentary i was met with a long pause marijuana she whispered in a half questioning half disapproving tone she could barely even say the word and her response filled me with selfdoubt even as a grown man mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word but just last week she suddenly stopped midconversation and said i am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing i waited for the other shoe to drop but it didnt instead she added you probably helped a lot of people who were suffering i dont think we had ever had a conversation like that one at that moment i saw a revolution that can bring you to tears the word revolution comes from the latin revolutio to turn around i had my own turn around a couple of years ago and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic even patients i spoke to were reluctant to share their stories it can be tricky i learned to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology when we put the first weed documentary on television in august 2013 i didnt know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation even worse i didnt even know if they would care is weed legal in your state just two years later in weed 3 we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing you will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for ptsd you will meet patients such as sean kiernan an accomplished investment banker and amelia taylor a stayathome mom they are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution  smart successful and suffering  unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat ptsd can be worse than the underlying disorder itself sean kiernan nearly died trying to get better you will see what weed really does to your brain in crystal clear images this time around you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view both democratic and republican senators and even the president of the united states this is what a revolution looks like your medical marijuana questions answered  when weed 2 cannabis madness aired in march 2014 boston researcher rick doblin believed the right people were watching just four days later doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study the federal farm where doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of ole miss in oxford mississippi in anticipation of a scientific revolution the production of researchgrade marijuana there has increased 30fold in just the past year make no mistake we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen it was the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for aids as well as stopping the spread of west nile virus they were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project the brain initiative and the precision medicine initiative there are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact  there is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults including treatment for cancer epilepsy and alzheimers to name a few with regard to pain alone marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country as i sat across from sens kirsten gillibrand dnew york and cory booker dnew jersey i knew something extraordinary was happening they were reciting the story of charlotte figi and countless other children they were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations they were extolling the potential virtues of the plant and all of that was before the interview even started there was an impatience about them and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform they want marijuana to be rescheduled they want it now they want doctors to be able to prescribe it at va hospitals all over the country they want it now they want research dollars freed up to study the plant they want it now they want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world including the citizens of the united states have known for a long time marijuana is a medicine that should be studied and treated like any other medicine and they want all of it now i spent much of our interview challenging them i needed to remind them that people long before me or them have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years and had been rejected every time i reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them i challenged them every step of the way this time will be different booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room is marijuana as safe as  or safer than  alcohol i know how easy it is do nothing because i did nothing for too long take a good look at the data educate yourself and talk to the patients who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant journalists shouldnt take a position it makes sense objectivity is king but at some point open questions do get answered at some point contentious issues do get resolved at some point common sense prevails so here it is we should legalize medical marijuana we should do it nationally and we should do it now 9 things to know about legal pot ",

visited the market for his project flower man which is a series of portraits that casts light upon the people behind the petals when hermann was in kolkata working on another assignment he went to the market as a tourist after that first encounter with malik ghat his captivation with the market did not diminish and he became intent on returning the flower sellers woke my curiosity but at that time i didnt really have the time to do the project hermann said and this idea just kind of stuck in my head for almost two years hermann was able to spend about 10 days at the market and did not allow any challenges to hinder the completion of flower man he said that in addition to language barriers and the heat of kolkata making communication complicated and shooting at certain times difficult another adversity he faced was taking portraits of the female flower sellers i had a really clear idea before i went to the market about what i wanted to do hermann said i wanted to shoot the sellers  the male and the female sellers but none of the female flower sellers wished to be a part of hermanns project so he focused only on those who were interested in and comfortable with having their portrait taken for the portraits hermann sought a neutral background he first tried shooting under a bridge near the market but quickly realized the lighting did not match the mood he wanted to create he then decided to create the portraits by the hooghly river this allowed him to combine the hazy smog in the air sunlight from above and studio lights of his own which culminated to produce a surreal effect and overexposed look that made his subjects stand out all the pictures are shot within noon and 3 pm when you have the sun straight from above which gives the portraits this very hard light hermann said and then i just used some studio light as a fill to make it a little bit more soft although the composition of the majority of hermanns portraits encompasses the flower sellers in front of a neutral background other portraits forgo this characteristic and consequently bring a sense of movement and fluidity to flower man viewers may see people or a dog appearing in a frame or even birds flying in the sky and a boat floating in the water one of the reasons hermann did not create the flower sellers portraits directly inside the market is because of the hectic atmosphere hermann compares malik ghat to the environments of financial trading and fish markets its impossible to shoot at the market especially if you want a clean and quiet background because theres so much going on hermann said social media  follow cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography similar to the commitment needed to effectively and successfully operate within the financial and food industries hermann emphasized that the competitive atmosphere of the market and work ethic of the flower sellers was a major factor in whether a seller would agree to have their portrait made all the other sellers  they are so busy so just convincing them to go near the river to get their portrait done and spend maybe 15 minutes of their time was a challenge hermann said because every minute theyre not standing in the flower market they lose money hermann said that another important reason some flower sellers decided not to be photographed was because flowers are highly valued in india and serve as a prominent feature during many events and moments in peoples lives including everything from religious rituals and festivals to weddings and parties some of the flowers the sellers didnt allow us to take pictures of because theyre flowers used for offering in the temple hermann said it was more a problem about the flowers than actually the guy behind because they didnt want us to take the pictures because the flowers would lose their purity challenging perceptions and breaking down barriers are underlying elements within flower man hermann said viewers must not make assumptions about the socioeconomic status of the sellers nor should they view the sellers through a fixed rigid lens regarding the behaviors and roles associated with gender noticeable throughout the portraits is that none of the sellers is smiling which is usually a behavior people tend to exhibit when in the presence of a camera the lack of a smile enhances the organic nature of flower man making the portraits a powerful representation of unforced and unfabricated human emotion if you want to take pictures in india people tend to just stand up and look proud and strong hermann said its very different from the western world because if you take pictures here people tend to smile like people flowers come in all shapes sizes and colors when viewing hermanns photos this fact leaves viewers to consider if it is not the flowers that are decorations but rather the sellers who bring vibrancy to the flowers in the portrait of sanju joshi for example he is engulfed in endless layers of orange they use these flowers in temples and all over india so thats one of the more common flowers at the market hermann said i really like that picture because they carry the flowers like it is a dress you should see when they walk through the flower market its almost like the flowers are all alive similarly the abundant leaves come to life in odhir gayens portrait these are a special kind of leaves and many of the sellers carry them on their head and on their arms hermann said and when they walk around its almost like a human bush or something like that hermann plans to return to malik ghat and looks forward not only to the opportunity to photograph different kinds of flowers  as the range varies based on the seasons  but also to the chance to present the flower sellers featured in flower man with their portraits i enjoyed this project hermann said theres a lot of photographers going to india and then showing a poor bad situation  i have a totally different approach i want to show some more proudness and find the beauty of people ken hermann is a photographer based in copenhagen you can follow him on facebook twitter and instagram",

        "article": "cnn the verdict of the opinion polls on the uk election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough between david cameron of the conservatives ed miliband of labour nick clegg of the liberal democrats nigel farage of the united kingdom independence party natalie bennett of the green party nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party and leanne wood of plaid cymru the welsh nationalists there really was no clear winner comres for itv which staged the debate had cameron miliband and farage tied first with 21 and sturgeon close behind on 20 icm for the guardian scored it miliband 25 cameron 24 farage 19 and sturgeon 17 yougov for the times put sturgeon first with 28 points to 20 for farage 18 for cameron and only 15 for miliband back in the 1950s uk politics was simpler labour and conservatives combined took 97 of the votes but nowadays they struggle to collect twothirds of the national vote between them in our antipolitics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders tv debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter from a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons  as the incumbent prime minister cameron is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with miliband alone in verbal fisticuffs he has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision miliband has been given a hard time by the british media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek but labours leader is a perfectly capable debater he could only gain from their confrontation as it is election time media exposure has already seen milibands ratings as a leader improve the electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging in an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by uk tvs grand inquisitor jeremy paxman cameron proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration on the number of people employed on zerohours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies miliband has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother david to get the leaders job the impression so far is that britains voters dont much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but dont quite trust labour to continue the improvement miliband told by his handlers to look tough is using the i word too much cameron is curiously short on passion an oddity of the seven up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved sturgeon of the scottish national party and wood of plaid cymru but sturgeons high score in the postdebate polls was significant she was sharp and sassy the number of seats gained by the nationalists currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 westminster parliament seats in scotland will be crucial last time labour won 41 of those seats the more the snp take the weaker labours chance of a majority at westminster will be miliband says he wont form a coalition with the snp but it could be difficult for labour to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border if there was a winner in the debate it was nicola sturgeon back in the 2010 uk election debates the clear victor was clegg of the liberal democrats then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting i agree with nick by entering a coalition government with cameron in which the lib dems insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery clegg surrendered the lib dems previous ability to pick up protest votes clegg and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government notably on student tuition fees his debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10 perception is everything in social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the greens and even for plaid cymrus wood but clegg got hardly a mention the united kingdom independence party remains the joker in the pack the party once dismissed by cameron as a collection of fruitcakes loonies and closet racists is a serious threat to the conservatives  and labour  despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately but ukip more than any of the others is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them grinning farages blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration his party wont win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests sometimes taking votes off the conservatives sometimes off labour farage has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60 of hiv cases he earned condemnation from other leaders on social media dominated by the young that earned him the maximum boo count to win a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself to wrongfoot your opponent and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum you need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign the highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money the emphasis has been on sound defense nobody has yet scored an exciting goal as the campaign moves on chances will have to be taken read fish bacon and beer the real issues in britains election ",

game playing cheating lying fighting the professor at the texas am university galveston campus expected his missive would create some conflict but that it could then be resolved quickly  and quietly those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage the story went viral suddenly his name was spreading on twitter facebook and reddit accompanied by the kind of strong unvarnished opinions that you can make about people youve never met he was a hero who taught todays entitled youth a muchneeded lesson or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit one thing was certain he and his employer were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for i did what i did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the internet horwitz said i will stand by what i did but im not career suicidal texas am says horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching but horwitz a nontenuretrack professor in the maritime administration program is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class the day before writing to his students horwitz wrote a similar email to the ceo of the texas am galveston campus and to the schools chief academic officer i have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful dishonest and disrespectful as his current strategic management class he wrote to the administrators he accused the students of shirking responsibility making excuses and complaining their way to better grades he would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class horwitz wrote the class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic he wrote but they are your problem now it was the next day that horwitz wrote to the students calling the class an embarrassment in general and said that i am frankly and completely disgusted once his words echoed in traditional and social media the narrative  angry prof flunks entire class  might as well have been set in stone the story was such a talker that even the onion offered a parody im not looking to fail students horwitz said i dont get a bonus for failing students the letter sounded a little bit more definite than i wanted it to he added he never actually changed anyones grade there were some students he wasnt going to fail he said and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out but horwitz stands by his tough stance there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed he said the course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses i had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a breakeven analysis the professor said if you cannot do a breakeven analysis then you dont deserve a bachelors degree in business his other complaint was about professionalism horwitz said students would swear at him cheat and spread rumors about him online this is related to their grades he said because dealing with people you dont like is a business skill on online message boards users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story one purported student called horwitz a little obnoxious but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral the fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public but maybe there is more to it the situation hits on a popular argument on the media and internet what do we think of millennials reflecting on his most recent class horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered he mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration the other factor is a failure of k12 education said horwitz who has met college students who dont know how to convert fractions to decimals what im trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance he said in a statement patrick louchouarn the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at texas am galveston campus said the entire class will not be failed each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester louchouarn said the university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies the flurry of attention is unwelcome and horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia but its likely his story will have a short shelf life people probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline but he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere he said he feels a public shaming of sorts online public shaming has become a research topic of its own people who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance this is really destroying my life horwitz said",

        "article": "cnn for years warren weinsteins family frantically searched for details about his whereabouts and pushed for his release his wife said she was still searching for answers thursday after us officials revealed the 73yearold american aid worker had been accidentally killed in a us drone strike targeting al qaeda we were so hopeful that those in the us and pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through elaine weinstein said in a statement we do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding warrens death but we do understand that the us government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances gunmen abducted weinstein in 2011 from his home in lahore parkistan they posed as neighbors offered food and then pistolwhipped the american aid worker and tied up his guards his family said just a few months after weinsteins capture al qaeda leader ayman alzawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding weinstein  and demanding among other things that the united states end airstrikes in pakistan us officials called for his release but repeatedly said washington wouldnt bargain with al qaeda weinstein  a husband father and grandfather from rockville maryland  was 73 years old when he was killed according to a family website detailing information about his case he worked in pakistan as a contractor for the us agency for international development from 2004 to 2011 the website says his employer virginiabased consulting firm je austin associates inc described him as a worldrenowned development expert warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make peoples lives better his wife said thursday he loved the pakistani people and their culture she said learning to speak urdu and doing everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region as he announced weinsteins death thursday us president barack obama praised what he said was weinsteins lifelong dedication to service first as a peace corps volunteer and later as a usaid contractor weinstein obama said was someone who willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of pakistan focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life this was a man who basically dedicated his life to service to people in general but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult  its tragic that he was killed the way he was former us ambassador dan simpson said simpson met weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in burundi  simpson as a diplomat and weinstein as a scholar researching several books weinstein was a very kind person simpson said and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with another hostage was also killed in the january operation italian aid worker giovanni lo porto us officials knew they were targeting an al qaeda compound in the afghanistanpakistan border region in the january counterterrorism operation obama said but they didnt know that the hostages were also there both lo porto and weinstein were people who believed passionately that they could make a difference obama said there could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al qaeda captors obama said thursday warrens work benefited people across faiths meanwhile al qaeda boasted to the world that it held warren citing his jewish faith weinsteins health had been deteriorating obama said last year daughter alisa weinstein told cnn her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma but it was still an optimistic time for the family that month captors released us army sgt bowe bergdahl and that buoyed hopes from weinsteins family that he could also be freed they have shown with this exchange that they can get this done if they want to they can do this alisa weinstein said at the time so i know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others but a prisoner swap never happened for weinstein even though his family pushed for one al qaeda released a video of weinstein on christmas 2013 he appeared gaunt and said he was suffering needless to say ive been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because i am not with them weinstein said in the video at the time a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring quite honestly i didnt recognize him in the picture laurie wiseberg told cnn he has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and i would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family his wife his children and grandchildren and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves at the time the washington post also reported that it had received a letter from weinstein the letter which was also posted on the website of the site intelligence group described his background doing human rights work the letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003 weinstein had worked as a college professor at the state university of new york  oswego as a peace corps country director in togo and ivory coast and for usaid and the world bank i hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the american government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that i am not forgotten and just become another statistic the letter said given my age and my health i dont have time on my side weinsteins wifes statement on thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the united states and pakistan for not doing more to help her husband while maryland members of congress  rep john delaney sen barbara mikulski and sen ben cardin  and members of the fbi were relentless in efforts to free her husband she said others in the us government were inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3\u00bd years we hope that my husbands death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the us government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families she said pakistani government and military officials also should have done more she said warrens safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself instead treating warrens captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority she said i hope the nature of our future relationship with pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these but ultimately she said her husbands captors are the ones responsible for his death i can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of pakistan she said the cowardly actions of those who took warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with islam and they will have to face their god to answer for their actions opinion could weinstein have been saved cnns elise labott jim sciutto and pamela brown contributed to this report",

our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there juraboev a citizen of uzbekistan is said to have posted i am in usa now but we dont have any arms but is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here what im saying is to shoot obama and then get shot ourselves will it do that will strike fear in the hearts of infidels the post earned juraboev a visit from federal agents several days later juraboev admitted that hed posted the message and that he believed in the isis agenda he also said that he would harm obama if he had the opportunity to do so but

        "article": "cnn it seems almost silly to be writing about baseball in the context of recent events  except it isnt last weekend as baltimore reacted to the death of freddie gray the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody major league baseball had a problem on its hands saturdays game between the orioles and red sox had gone into extra innings in camden yards with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats boston fans feel at home in oriole park  a socalled retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel  because much of it was based on bostons fenway park the boston faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports  but when the orioles finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning 36000 fans remained in their seats they had been asked to do so by baltimore officials due to  ongoing public safety issues the riots of baltimore the peaceful marches of baltimore the fury and unrest of baltimore did not seem to have had much to do with baseball  but as the alwayswise atlantic magazine writer and baltimore native tanehisi coates take on the situation quickly went viral it became clear that the orioles home stand presented a problem mondays game against the chicago white sox postponed less than an hour before the first pitch tuesdays game against the white sox also postponed such action by mlb is not without precedent  in 1967 in detroit the 12th street riots forced the tigers to postpone one game and relocate others to baltimore no less  after the assassination of martin luther king jr mlb postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence  in the wake of the 1992 verdict in the rodney king beating the los angeles dodgers postponed several games  the entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of september 11 2001 politics threaten sports all the time  from the demonstrations against the brazilian government before last summers world cup to the massacre of protesting students days before the opening ceremony of the mexico city olympics in 1968 sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world our deep investment in our teams  beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make and the profits the owners and sponsors draw  is supposed to work to create community to unify  cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging its interesting that i have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound  daniel nathan professor of american studies at skidmore college and editor of rooting for the home team sport community and identity told me  people did say that in the weeks after 911  this is not 911  not even close  but it is a serious social and cultural rupture painful what happens next is striking  after two postponements the orioles will play chicago on wednesday but no one else will be invited  in an unprecedented move by major league baseball the public is not invited to the final game of the series moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by baltimores mayor while there are a few examples of fanless games being played in the united states none have been for such reasons while in europe there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fanless games without fans does baseball mean anything when the new camden yards made its debut in 1992 people heralded the return of the oldtime stadium smack in the middle of the city  but are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the socalled good old days in a recent episode of real sports chris rock delivered a brilliant sevenminute diatribe on the fact that less than 10 of baseball players or fans are black last year the san francisco giants won it all without any black guys on the team he said the team the giants had to beat to get there the st louis cardinals had no black people none how could you ever be in st louis and see no black people rocks thesis  that baseballs sense of nostalgia encompassed by places like camden yards does not sit well with african americans whose memories of the old days are anything but good to his credit orioles executive vice president john angelos son of majority owner peter angelos took to twitter to prioritize the issues at hand focusing not on the lost games but on the unfairly impoverished population living under an everdeclining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an evermore militarized and aggressive surveillance state yet as much of america continues to grapple with the idea that black lives matter it is clear that the country believes sports do matter whether or not anyone is there to watch and with mlbs announcement that baltimores weekend games will be moved to tampa it becomes clear that the only thing that the united states has figured out about race relations poverty the achievement gap police brutality and so on is how to keep its baseball players safe and make sure that the games go on",

        "article": "lausanne switzerland cnn there are plenty of details left to iron out but negotiators took a significant step thursday toward a landmark deal aimed at keeping irans nuclear program peaceful after a marathon stretch of latenight negotiations in lausanne switzerland diplomats announced theyd come up with the framework for an agreement thats been months in the making iran would reduce its stockpile of lowenriched uranium by 98 and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges according to the plan in exchange the united states and the european union would lift sanctions that have crippled the countrys economy it is a good deal a deal that meets our core objectives us president barack obama said in a speech from the white house rose garden this framework would cut off every pathway that iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon the deal would include strict verification measures to make sure iran complies he said if iran cheats obama said the world will know it key points of the deal  the world powers involved in the talks with iran were the united states russia china france the united kingdom and germany for the united states and iran two countries with a long history of strained relations the negotiations took on an added significance just two years ago they hadnt talked with each other officially in nearly four decades i think there was a seriousness of purpose us secretary of state john kerry told cnn in an interview shortly after the framework was announced people negotiated hard it was tough very intense at times sometimes emotional and confrontational it was a very intensive process because the stakes are very high and because there is a long history of not talking to each other for 35 years we havent talked with the iranians directly like this on thursday iranian state television broadcast obamas speech live something many iranians described as unprecedented some iranians marked the historic moment in usiranian relations on twitter by sharing selfies of themselves in front of the live obama speech but us leaders were still talking tough even as they praised the agreement kerry stressed that if a final deal is reached with iran the removal of any sanctions against tehran will come in phases and if we find out at any point that iran is not complying with the agreement the sanctions can snap back into place he said iran didnt seem to be changing its tune either iranus relations had nothing to do with this this was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue  we have serious differences with the united states foreign minister javad zarif said after the deals framework was announced noting that mutual mistrust had been a serious problem in the talks the preliminary agreement will not put an end to irans enrichment activities zarif said none of those measures include closing any of our facilities the proud people of iran would never accept that he said but he said iran will abide by the agreement which would limit enrichment activities to one location he said 21 questions on iranian nuclear talks  but work on the deal isnt finished theres a june 30 deadline for coming up with a final agreement in the united states the obama administration could face an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical congress which has threatened to impose new sanctions on iran already there were rumblings of the looming political fight kerry said he didnt believe congress would block the deal telling cnn it would be very irresponsible to make politics trump facts and science and the realities of what is possible here house speaker john boehner said in a statement that he was planning to stand strong and press the administration with tough questions the president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the white houses initial goals he said arguing that congress must review details of a deal before any sanctions are lifted obama warned leaders of congress not to stop the deal if congress kills this deal not based on expert analysis and without offering any reasonable alternative then its the united states that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy obama said international unity will collapse obama maintains the deal would shut down irans path to getting a nuclear bomb but israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu says the opposite is true such a deal would not block irans path to the bomb it would pave it he said in a statement it would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war netanyahu has been lobbying against an agreement since the talks began warning us lawmakers in a congressional address last month that iran cant be trusted israeli government officials vowed to continue their push against what they called a poor framework that will lead to a bad and dangerous agreement if an agreement is reached on the basis of this framework it will result in a historic mistake that will make the world a far more dangerous place the israeli officials said in a statement this framework gives international legitimacy to irans nuclear program that aims only to produce nuclear bombs obama said that he was reaching out to netanyahu to explain and defend the tentative framework if in fact prime minister netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure that iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon this is the best option obama said negotiations between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council  china france russia the united kingdom and the united states  plus germany began in 2006 and have had a tortured history over the past nine years the push and pull over irans nuclear program produced a bewildering array of proposals meanwhile as talks dragged on the united states the european union and others imposed sanctions on iran provoking resentment among tehrans leaders who called the sanctions a crime against humanity the challenge all along was twofold to assure the international community that iran could not develop nuclear weapons which it denied in any event that it was doing and to accommodate the countrys assertion of its right  as a signer of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons  to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes the broad outlines of a deal seem to have been clear for some time but the devil was in the details and the numbers timing sequencing and verification procedures proved devilishly difficult to resolve until now the 2013 election of hassan rouhani a political moderate to irans presidency infused the talks with new hope though questions lingered over whether he could persuade the countrys hardliners to accept an agreement us leaders also were divided over the agreement as envisioned in a march 9 letter signed by 47 republican us senators irans leaders were warned that any deal not approved by the senate could immediately be revoked by president barack obamas successor in 2017 democrats denounced the sending of such a letter to foreign leaders as an unprecedented intervention in negotiations between the administration and another country and irans leaders also dismissed the letter  cnns elise labott reported from lausanne and mariano castillo and catherine e shoichet wrote

        "article": "cnn supported by american intelligence and supplied with advanced usmade weaponry saudi jets began airstrikes in yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdoms washington ambassador described as restoring the legitimate government and protecting a yemeni constitution and elections the need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy indeed saudi motives in yemen likely have nothing to do with protecting the countrys legitimate government its constitution or its electoral process so what is really going on the kingdoms real motives seem clear if one looks at saudi monarchys history of not allowing regional competition of any kind while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people this approach was evident in 2013 when saudi arabia voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of mohamed morsy in egypt which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary saudi policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the arab spring the saudi goal is simple prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks selfdetermination and the excuse of resisting irans influence meanwhile appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster for example in 2009 the houthis more accurately described as the ansarullah were not yet receiving help from iran yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes following saudi claims of a houthi incursion true the ansarullah movement now benefits from iranian support but it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region with all this in mind the american decision to stand behind the saudi attack on yemen can best be described as misguided although the houthi movements rhetoric is unquestionably antiamerican it has not targeted any american interests in fact when the us embassy packed up in sanaa in january leaving a fleet of over 20 armored suvs behind at the airport the houthis reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a un representative in yemen and while the houthis did not welcome the american presence in yemen they did not interfere with us operations against al qaeda in the country but one of the biggest miscalculations has been that us policy has adopted the saudigulf narrative on yemen effectively placing saudi ambitions to control yemen above previous american priorities like destroying the safe haven for al qaeda there indeed the obama administration appears to have abandoned yemen to saudi machinations this reality was underscored when us state department spokesperson jen psaki effectively endorsed saudi bombing saying the saudis have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in yemen on their security the implication here seems to be that any country concerned about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent back in september white house spokesman josh earnest described yemen as a success story in the war on terrorism explaining that the us priority in yemen was not to establish a jeffersonian democracy but to prevent yemen from becoming a safehaven for al qaeda and affiliates yet if that policy goal remains in place then it must be acknowledged that the saudi war on yemen will not only undermine the us aim of preventing al qaeda from making yemen a safe haven but also undermine broader us efforts in yemen the reality is that saudi and gulf cooperation council jets are effectively acting as al qaedas air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al qaeda from several yemeni regions interestingly while saudi arabia deployed about 100 aircraft against the houthis on the second day of its offensive it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early usled campaign against isis last year regardless the results of the saudi campaign are unlikely to be positive  one only need look at the way a much smaller houthi force than today was able to outfox the saudi military back in 2009 back then houthi forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters but they shocked the saudi army reportedly capturing saudi equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 saudi villages as it seized territory along the border today that ragtag group of houthi rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called ansarullah modeled after lebanons hezbollah back in 2009 the rebels were limited to parts of the saada region and were selffunded although yemen claimed they had minor assistance from the late libyan leader moammar gadhafi yet despite this they were still able to withstand some 90 days of saudi bombardment today the ansarullah group is receiving political financial and military support from iran already the saudi government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions the situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues what should be done now saudi interests in yemen should not replace those of the united states with this in mind the obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict one that can be embraced by the various yemeni factions a change in approach is essential not only because the saudiled war on yemen is wrong and destined to fail but because it might end up further opening the yemeni door to iran but perhaps most importantly by supporting a selfinterested saudi campaign the us may actually empower an al qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the united states",

        "article": "cnn chinas cybercensors have long used a great firewall to block its citizens from reading critical articles from western news websites or consuming other content it disapproves of but its no longer enough for them says a study published friday theyve developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders including in the united states the studys authors have named it the great cannon and it operates in plain sight going on the attack so visibly and handily within another countrys borders will probably draw international ire the studys authors say and beijing may have counted on that this is a powerful attack capability and we are curious about the risk and benefit analysis that led the chinese government to reveal it with this highly visible denial of service attack said researcher john scottrailton the reason chinese censors are taking that risk freespeech cyberactivists have found ways to get around the great firewall and give chinese readers greater access to the wests free press enter the great cannon it blasts targeted web servers with massive distributed denial of service attacks and it uses the web browsers of unsuspecting web surfers to do it the cannon wrecked two online services with ddos attacks in march say the researchers from the university of torontos citizen lab the international computer science institute the university of californiaberkeley and princeton university many of the researchers focus on the abuse of information technology to undermine civil liberties and human rights  and they are afraid this new cyberweapon could easily be used for an array of powerful attacks beyond what theyve already observed a modest technical change could turn the great cannon into a malware delivery device for infecting the computer of a target individual anywhere in the world who visits a chinese server scottrailton said this might include all emails headed in and out of china he said the device could replace genuine attachments with malicious files for example one of the great cannons targets that the researchers studied was an obvious one  greatfireorg run by chinese expats bent on fighting beijings censorship they monitor chinese citizens access to international news sites such as german news service deutsche welle or the tibet post but the other target may seem odd at first glance github is a popular silicon valley hosting service used by programmers who want to share code with each other the two attacks were connected however the study says greatfireorg hosted two github repositories that contained computer code allowing chinese readers to get around the great firewall and read the new york times in chinese critical articles from the times are a particular fly in the ointment for beijing and china has turned away at least three of the papers reporters in short succession according to a us congressional commission on china github said it thought the attackers were trying to coerce it into taking content offline greatfireorg says it suspects the attack may have been in response to a wall street journal article on its struggle to circumvent chinese censors both services suspected china was behind their attacks and used the great firewall to carry it out according to statements and media reports by triggering attacks and analyzing them the researchers concluded that beijing has developed a tool distinctly different from the great firewall they are confident it is also in china and say it is technically similar to the great firewall the firewall in a manner of speaking stands aside and watches all digital traffic going in and out of china the researchers say if it sees requests going out into the world for content it doesnt want citizens to see the researchers say it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the chinese users computer to make them stop communicating the user might see an http 403 reply  sorry youre not authorized to see this page not only does the great firewall monitor tons of traffic but its systems have to do a lot of processing to discern what to block and what not so its workintensive the great cannon takes on a much lighter load because it doesnt care about all that traffic instead it targets traffic between a handful of web addresses but it uses web traffic unrelated to its targets to build its attack against them users going to baidu one of chinas most prolific web services and most successful internet companies can become unknowing proxy warriors against the great cannons targets the study says in the overwhelming number of cases when traffic came into china from the outside world the great cannon let it through to baidus advertising servers but in a tiny fraction of the cases the researchers observed it picked out computers it wanted to use in the attack and sent bad code back to the users browser the malicious script enlisted the requesting user as an unwitting participant in the ddos attack against greatfireorg and github the authors wrote their browsers mercilessly fired requests at both sites and paralyzed them at the time of writing they number 26 billion requests per hour greatfireorg wrote during an outage in march websites are not equipped to handle that kind of volume so they usually break and go offline github said the march incident was the biggest ddos attack in its history back then the programmers noticed that there were unique aspects about the attack these include every vector weve seen in previous attacks as well as some sophisticated new techniques that use the web browsers of unsuspecting uninvolved people to flood githubcom with high levels of traffic they wrote baidu denies any involvement in the attacks and says its internal security has remained intact the researchers said but government cybercensors monitoring of traffic to and from baidus servers could hurt its reputation as a major player in international commerce fully encrypting web traffic should help to defend against the great cannon scottrailton said chinese president xi jinping is a communist party hardliner and since he took office in november 2012 chinese citizens have felt the grip tightening again on freedoms they thought they had gained journalists and activists say xi and the politburo are responding to new threats by falling back on repressive tactics rather than experimenting with more liberal policies think tank freedom house wrote in an analysis and repression has particularly targeted grassroots activists online opinion leaders and ordinary citizens on the internet xi also has a reputation for eyeing western values with suspicion and considering american it companies such as intel and google partners of the us government deployment of the gc great cannon may also reflect a desire to counter what the chinese government perceives as us hegemony in cyberspace the researchers write the authors say the united states and great britain already have methods for intercepting unencrypted traffic and launching attacks",

        "article": "washington cnn until recently if you sat in church on sunday mornings pollsters could predict where you stood on samesex marriage what a difference a decade makes in 2003 when the massachusetts supreme court became the countrys first to legalize samesex marriage less than 30 of religiously affiliated americans supported gays and lesbians right to wed by 2014 that number had climbed to 47 according to a survey conducted by the public religion research institute thats more than the 45 who said they opposed samesex nuptials the margin is small but statistically significant said robert p jones ceo of prri because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents 40000 adult americans eight percent refused to answer or said they didnt know their stance on samesex marriage according to prris poll there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it a dramatic turn in one of this countrys most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race theres been a huge swing in the last decade said jones there are now big mainstream groups on both sides of the debate if the us supreme court has been paying attention it likely saw this trend coming each time the high court has considered a case related to samesex marriage the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse on tuesday for example as the supreme court hears oral arguments in obergefell v hodges a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on samesex marriage an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of washingtons national cathedral is planning to march in support of lgbt rights i join with many across the spectrum of american faith communities in my hope that the courts ruling will permit samesex marriage in all 50 states the very rev gary hall the cathedrals dean said in a statement i trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek gods blessing on their marriages clergy from halls religious denomination the episcopal church have also submitted an amicus brief in support of samesex marriage the brief is endorsed by nearly 2000 faith leaders including rabbis methodist ministers lutheran bishops seminary professors and congregationalist chaplains another brief submitted by the antidefamation league is signed by jewish hindu and presbyterian groups in a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform samesex nuptials prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well including the us conference of catholic bishops national association of evangelicals southern baptist convention assemblies of god and the church of jesus christ of latterday saints also known as the mormon church together leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million americans but as prris survey shows there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews despite vocal opposition from the us catholic bishops for example 60 of catholics now favor samesex marriage thats a huge increase from 2003 when just 35 backed gay rights according to survey conducted at the time by the pew research center mainline protestants  socalled for their prominence in 20th century american life  also saw a huge shift in the last decade while 36 supported samesex marriage in 2003 now 62 do at a glance the progay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse encompassing buddhists catholics jews and hindus but the protraditional marriage crowd is just as motley bridging black protestants mormons muslims and white evangelicals according to prris survey samesex marriage rights worldwide  legalized nationwideargentina belgium canada denmark iceland netherlands norway portugal spain south africa sweden  legalized in certain regionsbrazil mexico united states  civil unions or domestic partnershipsandorra austria brazil colombia czech republic ecuador finland france germany greenland hungary ireland liechtenstein luxembourg new zealand slovenia switzerland united kingdom uruguay and parts of australia mexico united states and venezuela  the survey data comes from prris american values atlas conducted between april and december of last year prri is a nonpartisan nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and american culture separate surveys conducted by prri and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for samesex marriage is coming from younger americans seven in 10 millennials for example support samesex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics half of millennial republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and 43 of white evangelical millennials agree those numbers could put gop presidential candidates in a tight spot said jones as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger americans the real challenge for gop candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation jones said politicians may pivot on samesex marriage but biblebelieving christians should not  even if public opinion turns against them said denny burk a professor at boyce college a southern baptist school in louisville kentucky for me the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue there are periods when the gospel is popular and periods when its not you cant base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment still burk said he doesnt doubt that more millennials accept samesex marriage and he fully expects the supreme court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this june when the justices render a decision in obergefell v hodges but the fight is far from over burk said just like weve seen this decadeslong culture war with abortion were going to see the same thing with gay marriage",

of the 21st century the fruits of radical islam the results of the obama white houses innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the evergrowing numbers of victims of radical islam in the middle east north africa and south asia not to mention here in the united states canada and europe is it not a tragic irony that the arab springera policies of a nobel peace prize recipient accommodated the transition of syria into the worlds newest jihad theater while leaving libya a failed state and yemen a failing state the syrian jihad gave rise to the islamic state in iraq and syria which now uses syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in iraq which could soon spill over into jordan plus libya is now being used as a rear operating base by isis and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the middle east even as they plan attacks in europe and north america given the frightfully slow pace americas commanderinchief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both isis and its progenitor al qaeda the picture of whats in store is clear the body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buyin for their agendas and neither the united states nor our western allies are immune to this cancer academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of isis and al qaeda as distinctly different but the fact is they are not  their agendas which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today are manifestations of radical islam of course its hardly a surprise president barack obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms  the president and his national security advisers have too often proven na\u00efve with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is but as they hope it could be there is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the worlds most powerful politician and his national security team just take the national strategy for counterterrorism published by the white house in 2011 that document contained the assertion that since the beginning of 2011 the transformative change sweeping north africa and the middle east  along with the death of osama bin laden  has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat particularly as the relevance of al qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished yet fast forward to january 2014 and americas top intelligence official director of national intelligence james clapper advised congress that al qaeda was no less capable of threatening the united states and our allies than a decade earlier soon after clapper acknowledged al qaeda was not a band on the run as president obama had described the terrorist enterprise a report by terrorism expert seth jones of the rand corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the white house  as restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like libya tunisia and egypt during the arab spring those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups  including al qaeda and groups aligned with it according to data compiled by jones from 2010 through 2013 the number of salafi jihadist groups increased by 58 these groups are fueled by salafiyya jihadiyya an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al qaeda but is the source code for the agenda of the al qaeda offshoot isis most recently absent from the national security strategy produced by the obama white house in february 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al qaeda yes osama bin laden was killed on president obamas watch but contrary to what the white house seemed to think in 2011 bin ladens death has not lifted the shadow he casts over americas or our allies security indeed within days of our new national security strategys publication date in the seventh issue of isiss englishlanguage magazine dabiq the groups leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin laden while accusing his successor ayman alzawahiri of steering al qaeda off the path of its former leader meanwhile yemen  home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the al qaeda branch that claimed credit for the january 2015 attack in paris at the office of charlie hebdo  has also become a failed state aqap is helmed by the secondhighestranking official in al qaeda writ large and the obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al qaedas global network so it is interesting that in the months before the yemeni government was overthrown by iranbacked rebels president obama described the usyemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al qaeda  interesting because the president did not do more to help that partner government remain in power once again the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the middle east what were they thinking and how do they plan to combat aqap now despite what the white house wants the world to believe a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities  isis controls a large amount of territory in the middle east and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as libya and afghanistan while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the west and although isis is trying to out al qaeda al qaeda resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world al qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the united states and our allies today than it was in january 2014 at the same time the routine failures of president obama and his advisers to understand the security environment and to appropriately tailor americas national security posture in a manner demanded by it foretells more disasters lie ahead not only americans but also our allies should be very very afraid indeed president obamas refusal to simply call a problem like radical islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical islamist groups history has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders dont face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it president obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that but if he wants to help define a future for the middle east and north africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yesmen surrounding him at the white house there is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe indeed president obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from arab states are saying behind closed doors most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating isis and al qaeda however all of them recognize that unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better the united states will have to deploy considerably more of our kinetic resources to put those victories in sight this does not mean a ground forcesintensive response is required from us at this time but if the president thinks it prudent to wait on our arab partners to do most of the heavy lifting he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the nottoodistant future",

        "article": "cnn its the kind of thing you see in movies like robert redfords role in all is lost or ang lees life of pi but in real life its hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days weeks if not months and somehow living to talk about it miracles do happen though and not just in hollywood were not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the us coast guard much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water theyd brought aboard if any in order to survive they cant bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city town or boat  but instead must rely on ingenuity resourcefulness and luck its hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly with a sailor dying at sea except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues such happy endings do occur  given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts below are a few recent examples  louis jordan says that he set off on his 35foot sailboat from south carolina in late january he headed into the gulf stream looking for a good spot to catch fish and then everything  his boat his life  turned upside down rescued man says he is utterly thankful not only did his boat capsize but its mast broke jordan said and so too did his shoulder he bought time by rationing water then collecting fresh water in a bucket as to food jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail but jordan said it took so long it moved so slowly his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a germanflagged container ship the houston express spotted jordan about 200 miles off the north carolina coast on thursday after their reunion his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads i thought i lost you jose salvador alvarenga says his journey began in paredon viejo a port on mexicos pacific coast in late 2012 the exact date is up for debate  he says he set off in december locals say it was november but whats not in doubt is that after he left he disappeared until january 2013 thats when alvarenga interacted with humans once again thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the marshall islands castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in pacific  what was supposed to be a oneday trip he says turned into an arduous odyssey across the pacific ocean one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course then a storm hit causing their boat which was about three people long and one wide to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems four weeks in alvarenga said his partner  23yearold ezequiel cordova according to the boats owner  died because he refused to eat raw birds the days weeks and months ran together after that alvarenga says he drank rainwater and when there wasnt any available his own urine he ate sea turtles then after 13 or 14 months adrift he and his small heavily damaged boat arrived on the ebon atoll about a 22hour boat ride from the marshall islands capital of majuro the atoll has one phone line no internet service and a few residents two of whom alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods the el salvador native told cnn that his faith in god helped him survive i thought i am going to get out he said get out get out get out some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement reining it in a few notches as life slows down and if you live in hawaii theres even more reason to take it easy the thing is ron ingraham isnt one of those people hes a fisherman the sea is both his life and livelihood his son zakary told cnn and hes tough with his son jokingly comparing him to rambo still even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what ron ingraham went through after setting off around last thanksgiving solo from the hawaiian island of molokai son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea  after bad weather hit ron ingraham told cnn affiliate khnlkgmb that his 25foot sailboat went backwards all night long at one point a huge wave struck  pushing his mast into the water and him as well the 67yearold used a rope to pull himself back in but his boat couldnt be rescued so easily leaving him at the mercy of the current a distress call went out prompting a search that would cover 12000 square miles when a coast guard official told him the search was being called off december 1 zakary ingraham responded i dont feel like hes dead i dont feel it he was right twelve days after that first distress call ron ingraham was picked up about 64 miles 103 kilometers south of honolulu weak hungry and dehydrated and  most importantly  alive the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him in february 2012 two friends asked 18yearold adrian vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition he said yes and the three set off from the panama town of san carlos on a small boat vasquezs mother nilsa de la cruz recalled things started out well by all accounts the three caught plenty of fish then their boats engine died without warning and with no tools and scant navigational experience the trio didnt know what to do according to vasquezs mother mother calls panama teens return a miracle vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat the fifty cents further and further from the coast and into the pacific ocean somewhere along the way his two companions died its not clear exactly how with ecuadorian rear adm freddy garcia calle saying vasquez threw their bodies into the sea because they had become badly decomposed some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the galapagos islands the ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor whod lost 20 pounds and showed severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition according to calle he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal for us this is an opportunity to get closer as a family his mother said by phone to be more understanding and loving sometimes one doesnt have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled sometimes people dont have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end for proof look no further than hiromitsu shinkawa 60yearold man waves red flag to alert rescuers  he was at home on march 11 2011 when a massive 90 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of tokyo a devastating tsunami followed its 30foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors by the time it had run the course nearly 16000 people were dead its a miracle shinkawa wasnt one of them shortly after the quake he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of minamisoma his home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge powerful tsunami wave i was saved by holding onto the roof the 60yearold said according to kyodo news agency but my wife was swept away more than two days later video showed shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles 15 kilometers out to sea he was waving a selfmade red flag after being spotted by crew aboard a japanese maritime selfdefense force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears kyodo reported shinkawa told his rescuers i thought today was the last day of my life",

        "article": "cnn the arrest and death of freddie gray in baltimore has stoked protests and accusations of police brutality but its unclear how gray arrested on a weapons charge april 12 suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later here are the big questions surrounding this explosive case  grays arrest  what we know gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a highcrime area of baltimore known for drugs he gave up without the use of force according to  baltimore deputy police commissioner jerry rodriguez an officer apparently took his taser out and was prepared to use it on gray but he never deployed it rodriguez said and none of the six officers involved in the arrest describe using force against the 25yearold gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk said rodriguez who described gray as upset and when mr gray was taken out of that van he could not talk and he could not breathe according to rodriguez what we dont know its unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest and its also unknown what if anything happened inside the van the knife  what we know court documents allege that baltimore police department officer garrett miller arrested gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket the gray family attorney called the allegation a sideshow gray was carrying a pocket knife of legal size attorney william murphy told cnn police never saw the knife and chased gray only after he ran from them the attorney said the court documents also say that gray fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence the officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket the defendant was arrested without force or incident the documents say the knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted onehandoperated knife maryland law makes it illegal to wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind concealed on or about the person including switchblades what we dont know its not clear that simply having a knife is a crime said baltimore mayor stephanie rawlingsblake it is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone so we still have questions she said what can be seen on the released video  what we know segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after gray has been arrested and show officers dragging gray who is handcuffed to a van he can be heard screaming he was dragged a bit said rawlingsblake but then you see him using his legs to get into the van so he was ablebodied when he was in the van and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van he was unresponsive officers placed more restraints on gray inside the van police said while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking that was at 854 am at 924 am police called an ambulance for gray police say gray requested medical attention including an inhaler and an ambulance later took him to the university of maryland medical centers shock trauma center what we dont know its unknown why gray screamed and the video doesnt capture the entire incident start to end its unclear what happened between 854 am and 924 am police response  what we know in the wake of grays death six police officers have been suspended their names were released tuesday a standard procedure after an incustody death said baltimore police department spokesman capt eric kowalczyk it doesnt mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved he said they are lt brian rice 41 who joined the department in 1997 officer caesar goodson 45 who joined in 1999 sgt alicia white 30 who joined in 2010 officer william porter 25 who joined in 2012 officer garrett miller 26 who joined in 2012 and officer edward nero 29 who joined in 2012 police commissioner anthony batts said that authorities plan to conclude their investigation by may 1 their findings will go to the states attorneys office where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed what we dont know the officers say they didnt use force against gray but thats not certain grays past runins with authorities  what we know according to court documents cnn obtained there were more than 20 criminal court cases in maryland against gray and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death the cases involve mostly drugrelated charges but there are charges from march for seconddegree assault and destruction of property gray was due in court on a possession charge on april 24 he had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases said maryland department of corrections spokesman gerard shields in february 2009 he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved gray was paroled on june 30 2011 on april 4 2012 gray was arrested for violating parole but he didnt go back to prison shields said reasoning that  whatever gray allegedly did it was something minor gray went back to prison again in may 2013 for drug possession and served a month he was released in june what we dont know its not known whether grays criminal past had anything to do with his arrest or his death cnns anneclaire stapleton stephanie gallman and eliott c mclaughlin dana

been a blinkandyoumissit campaign especially by us standards where candidates can take years to finesse their messages the election could result in the handing of power from david camerons conservative government to the labour party led by ed miliband  or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties but thats all to come when polls close late thursday evening local time very strict rules govern the reporting of uk elections but until they kick in here are some things you should know  who are the candidates what are the issues whos likely to win why bacon sandwiches matter what is ukip and if the queen isnt in charge what does she do the queen doesnt run britain  before we get on to the candidates lets dispel one common misconception queen elizabeth ii is officially britains head of state but shes only nominally in charge she signs off on legislation and appoints new prime ministers but has no real power so no

government voters put their x next to the local stoogeaspiring public servant from whichever political party they support votes are tallied by constituencies  political fiefdoms really  some of which date back centuries to when britain was run by barons or maybe even elves  each with a seat in parliament the party that wins most seats then gets to say who becomes prime minister pending the final

contested of the election south hill park gardens london 44 20 7332 3322 is that a fair system kinda but also kinda not since it means a party can easily win power without winning the most votes thats because britains elections are run on a firstpastthepost basis its an analogy that highlights how similar british politics is to horse racing just with fewer doping scandals heres how it works  the elected parliament consists of 650 seats each representing a different number of constituents  anywhere between 21000 and 110000 only the candidate who wins most votes in each constituency gets a seat no prizes for second place of course there have been reform demands from smaller parties stiffed by the system but since they never win against the two main parties theyre powerless to change anything the centrist liberal democrats for instance had 68 million votes 23 of the total at the last election but won just 57 seats the conservatives claimed 307 with just 107 million votes visit luskentyre beach isle of harris the stunning islands of the outer hebrides off the western coast of mainland scotland are part of the uks smallest constituency by voter numbers visitscotlandcominfotownsvillagesluskentyresands  so whos going to win british elections are typically viewed as a twohorse race  an analogy that highlights how similar they are to races involving two horses only with fewer horses the prime candidates are incumbent david cameron head of the centerright conservatives and ed miliband leader of the centerleft labour party opinion polls say theres no clear favorite thatll mean  as it did in 2010  that the spoils of victory could be claimed by whoever can successfully horse yes horse trade to build a majority coalition alongside smaller parties if

medical care has triggered outrage across the country hundreds of protesters peacefully rallied on the streets of baltimore on saturday against the alleged police role in grays death a small group

journalist giordano was released without any charges cell phone video of grays arrest shows him screaming and being dragged with some witnesses saying he looked like his leg was injured baltimore police commissioner anthony batts said he was appalled that gray did not receive proper care immediately he also said officers should have given gray timely medical care multiple times  such as at the site of the arrest and at other times during his transport to the police station batts also said there are no excuses for the fact that gray was not buckled into the transport van but baltimores fraternal order of police lodge 3 shot back these comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioners own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete union president gene ryan said in a written statement five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators batts said the sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions and while the preliminary work on grays autopsy has been completed the medical examiners office is waiting on toxicology results and might ask spinal experts to look at the case authorities said a full report could take 30 to 45 days not just freddie gray others who died in police custody  holly yan reported and wrote from atlanta miguel

to his gunshot wounds dzhokhar jahar tsarnaevs defense team is seeking to spare him from a death sentence for his part two years ago in the boston marathon bombings and murder of an mit police officer having focused on his dead older brother portraying tamerlan tsarnav as harsh overbearing and bent on jihad they now shift to the younger brother who tagged after him as one witness said like a puppy the sentencing phase of the federal case will resume monday the jury was sent home thursday because a juror was sick tsarnaev was convicted april 8 on all 30 counts including 17 that carry a possible death penalty the defenses transition from one brother to the other begins in the ambulances that rushed the brothers from their respective final showdowns with police in watertown massachusetts on april 19 2013 boston bombing survivor i am not limiting myself  tamerlan dying from gunshot wounds and having been run over by the car his brother was driving as he fled became combative in the ambulance a paramedic testified wednesday that it was common for patients in shock to become agitated and fight back he had an abdominal wound it was an evisceration said paramedic michael sullivan it was a penetrating wound with the intestines protruding every time we tried handson he resisted that type of treatment sullivan said he was yelling loud like an rrrrrrrr type of thing it was like he was trying to get out of the seat belts that were holding him on the stretcher jahar on the other hand was cooperative after his capture hours later  until a tourniquet was applied too tightly said paramedic laura lee he responded to questions giving his date of birth and saying he was allergic to cats and then he asked a question of his own  where is my brother the defense showed a series of photographs that demonstrated how the brothers differed in size and age the younger brother has been portrayed as someone who follows rather than leads one of tamerlans boxing coaches testified earlier that jahar followed his brother around like a puppy the defense asserts that the boston marathon bombings never would have happened if it werent for tamerlan they have portrayed him as obsessed with jihad spending hours in his computer trolling al qaedastyle websites an uncle in russia told the fbi that tamerlan came there in 2012 expecting to find jihad in the streets magomed kartashov was questioned by the fbi after 40 days in a russian jail the fbi summary report of the interview was read in court kartashov said his nephew asked him if he had contacts with people in the forest as locals referred to the jihadists tamerlans information came from the internet but he had surprisingly little knowledge of islam the uncle told the fbi when he asked his nephew why he wanted to go to the forest he responded that jihad was necessary today kartashov told the fbi i told him to stop or he wouldnt make it to the next tree jahar on the other hand was portrayed in the testimony of five of his former teachers as a smart sweet kid who worked hard and earned good grades he was super kind extremely smart a very hard worker really a lovely person said tracey gordon his fifthgrade teacher at cambridgeport school all the teachers loved him said becki norris who had jahar in her seventhgrade class at community charter school a middle school in cambridge known for setting its students on the path to full ticket scholarships to good colleges he was one of our top students and one of our top athletes norris said he wasnt a rebel if you asked him to do something hed do it like most middleschoolers hes need a little push but he needed just one  but after just a few days in the ninth grade jahars mother pulled him out of the school and sent him to cambridge rindge and latin a large public high school she was angry that her son had been sent home to change out of his blue pants she was very very angry because he didnt have clean pants that matched the uniform and they didnt have the money norris said i thought he liked the school and i didnt think he wanted to go norris said she asked jahar if she could call his mother he flatly said no dont call her  he made friends in high school and a core group got together regularly for bro nights during their freshman year at the university of massachusetts dartmouth two young women testified they smiled at tsarnaev from with witness stand but while he seemed generally more animated in court he maintained his usual flat expression he was loyal fun laidback said classmate tiarrah dottin she said she had no idea he was listening to jihadi songs or watching al qaeda videos on his laptop she bowed her head and wiped tears from her eyes as she stepped off the witness stand and took a seat in the audience alexa guevara testified that tsarnaev was private about his family and did not discuss politics or religion with her she said when he spoke about the future he said he planned to transfer to the university of massachusetts amherst and study marine biology he was a supportive friend she added he encouraged me to go to art school she said she showed him her sketches and he thought they were good he said i had talent and shouldnt let it go to waste i should go to art school and do what made me happy it made me feel really good like somebody believed in me she said she ended her testimony with a memory of one of the last times she saw tsarnaev and the bros it was march 2013 during spring break of their sophomore year they went out to eat and then drove to a spot by the charles river jahar went over to his car and he got a backpack and there were fireworks inside she recalled he set one up and ignited it it didnt work the second one did work we were all whooping and hollering jahar was jumping

        "article": "lausanne switzerland cnn a rollercoaster series of talks wrapped up thursday in lausanne as a group of world powers known as the p51 reached a framework agreement with iran over the countrys nuclear program the success of that agreement remains to be seen the parties have until the end to june to work out the details and put the plan to paper but the talks this week were nevertheless historic particularly for the otherwise frozen usiranian relationship but thats not to say they were glamorous in fact the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best but also at its most hectic tucked amid the swiss alps on the shores of lake geneva lausanne is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks  a sort of camp david for the rich and famous but make no mistake the site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage over the course of the eightday round of talks negotiators their delegations their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the fivestar beaurivage palace hotel which played host to the negotiations this isnt the first time the hotel has provided a backdrop to a major diplomatic event in 1923 the treaty of lausanne was signed there breaking up the ottoman empire and defining the borders of modernday turkey more recently the hotel has been a getaway for wealthy tourists and the occasional celebrity coco chanel famously lived there in the late 1940s and early 1950s and even had her dog buried on the hotel grounds some reports say it was tough very intense at times the setting is idyllic and the grounds are beautifully maintained the firstfloor terrace even features a largescale chess board which served this week as an artful analogy for the game of nuclear chess going on just inside for the negotiators the past week was marked by a marathon run of meetings sometimes lasting throughout the night in an interview with cnn shortly after the framework agreement was announced secretary of state john kerry said i think there was a seriousness of purpose in meetings with the iranians people negotiated hard he added it was tough very intense at times sometimes emotional and confrontational that sentiment was echoed by iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif even as the talks were still going on over the past 18 months since talks began zarif said negotiators have developed personal respect for one another even though serious mistrust still exists between iran and the western powers we have a very serious problem of confidence  mutual lack of confidence we need to address  and we hope that this process will remedy some of that he added media giveandtake  zarif made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake thursday such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels kerry was seen riding a bike on at least one occasion and dining at a nearby crepery on another with both occasions prompting a cacophony of camera flashes reporters briefly followed chinese foreign minister wang yi as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in lausanne on sunday and zarif took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel perhaps just hoping to take in the view but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock the officials sometimes bemoaned the media circus but they also used the attention to bolster their demands during negotiations making statements to reporters that they hoped strengthened their footing in talks with their foreign counterparts people often use you guys to deliver messages to the negotiation a senior administration official who asked not to be named told reporters on the flight back to lausanne as do the iranians i think theyre quite skilled actually at using the media to deliver messages and to try to shape the frame of the negotiation the official said different orbits  more than 600 reporters were credentialed to cover the talks this week many of these were based in a large workspace at the nearby olympic museum meanwhile the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges allowing them access to the hotel where the talks took place while these journalists had a bit more access to officials they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building including the hotels reception desk the firstfloor restrooms and the twomichelinstar restaurants entrees costing 200 francs or more many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline for meals the crowd dispersed to a dozen or so nearby restaurants where they could enjoy 25franc pizzas and 60franc hamburgers washed down with 8franc bottles of water of course also popular a thai place around the corner that offered quick takeout  a plus for reporters on a deadline wed all take deep breaths and try again in the closedoff wings of the beaurivage the pace of meetings was frantic as different subsets of delegates gathered in ornate conference rooms there was a sense of urgency both before and after the initial march 31 deadline passed to reach a final understanding so the foreign ministers could leave switzerland ahead of other time commitments not to mention the easter holiday the process was further complicated by restrictions on the flight crew for kerrys plane which could stay on standby at the airport for only a limited number of hours in a given time period wed get close we kept on changing the plane schedule a senior administration official told reporters it would go it wouldnt go we had to reset the clock on the evening the understanding was finally announced the window had already lapsed requiring kerry and his team to depart at 3 am friday there were many moments throughout the negotiations when we thought wed call it a day call it a night decide wed gone as far as we could go said the official who briefed reporters on kerrys plane then wed all take deep breaths and try again but perhaps the most difficult night for negotiators was between wednesday and thursday just before the final sticking points were resolved for a deal it was a very very intense said the official it went from 9  about 9 in the evening until 6 in the morning when we all decided wed reached a couple of roadblocks didnt know whether wed be able to get past them and we were all utterly utterly exhausted so we all went to sleep by maybe 7 got up again and started again about 930 and engaged on what we thought were the really final issues the official added rushing to report the agreement  that morning the deal began to solidify and plans for the announcement were set into motion the announcement that an agreement had been reached sparked some chaos it was first sent out by the european delegation which spread the word to its traveling press corps even as negotiators were still meeting as news began to get out one european reporter ran frantically into the media area at the hotel urging everyone to listen his message theres going to be an announcement there are buses waiting to take you to the auditorium of a nearby university where it will take place and with that the room devolved into chaos as journalists ran for the doors the eightdaylong diplomatic event had hit its crescendo before finally subsiding by midday friday the delegations had left lausanne along with most of the media returning the scenic swiss city to its more tranquil pace",

        "article": "cnn a jury of rolling stones media peers has dissected the magazines disastrous discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia and the emerging consensus is that rolling stones lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice  made all the worse by the magazines headinthe sand reaction to the thorough devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism rolling stones egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable the magazines decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not before the original story a rape on campus was pulled from the rolling stone website it registered 27 million hits following its publication in november  more than any noncelebrity story in the magazines history an anonymous undergraduate given the name jackie told rolling stone writer sabrina rubin erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by phi kappa psi fraternity in 2012  only to end up beaten and gangraped by seven boys who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student a casual acquaintance who had invited jackie to the party the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity  a police investigation the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses but the story began to unravel almost immediately when washington post reporter t rees shapiro took a closer look leading rolling stone to back away from the story and request a review by the columbia university graduate school of journalism that review which is considerably longer than the original article reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice rolling stone writer erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations she never spoke to three of jackies friends who allegedly talked with jackie immediately after the attack and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when and at every step of the way when jackie began acting flaky  refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter  neither erdely nor her editors or the magazines fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade including one semester at columbia i would agree with colleagues who call rolling stones lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom ive told students for years you should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond and you should never take a sources word about important facts without verifying the truth theres a reason we call it reporting and not dictation most of all i tell students remember that youre writing about human beings who are complicated creatures the good guys are never all that good and the bad guys usually arent completely bad people can be mistaken or deceitful i tell young reporters they frequently forget and often lie to themselves that doesnt make a source useless but it must make you extra careful unfortunately the early word from rolling stone is that theyve absorbed none of these lessons publisher jann wenner has apparently decided not to fire demote or discipline anybody at rolling stone provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists no one fired at rolling stone really wrote cnn media critic brian stelter what would rolling stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably damaged peoples lives but punished no one tweeted john bresnahan the capitol bureau chief of politico rolling stone outsources its investigation to columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward ok tweeted pundit joe concha worse still the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim rolling stones senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the storys failure does not require them to change their editorial systems the columbia report says and check out this amazing conclusion from will dana the managing editor who presided over the disaster dana told the columbia team its not like i think we need to overhaul our process and i dont think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things we just have to do what weve always done and just make sure we dont make this mistake again that smug attitude pretty much ensures rolling stones newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future at a minimum they should heed the wise counsel of my friend bill grueskin an executive editor at bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the columbia jschool when doing big investigative stories reporters face many challenges recalcitrant sources complex numbers buried records editors whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity are spared most of those hurdles but they face their own internal newsroom challenges particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story grueskin writes they must keep their star reporters happy trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic the problem could be says grueskin that rolling stone had too many chefs in the kitchen instead of a single talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae until wenner and his team learn that basic lesson  and revamp their hiring editing and factchecking process accordingly  the rolling stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming",

celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in america a pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four  who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer  to a service open to the public an overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy april afternoon at word ministries christian center in summerville which has a capacity of about 300 people the flagdraped casket of the us coast guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as scotts relatives and friends followed some dabbed tears others embraced hundreds including local officials assembled inside the packed sanctuary  in corridors under an awning at the entrance wherever they could stand silence filled the vast space as scotts daughter samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father anthony scott said god had selected his brother as a candidate for change in america the change will come he said bringing to the crowd to its feet the head of the church george hamilton spoke of how scott had brought members of his family to the church of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video the death of scott who was black at the hands of a white police officer was motivated by racial prejudice hamilton said it was an act of overt racism hate came because walter was an africanamerican he said hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement but he singled out the officer who killed scott as a disgrace to the north charleston police department there is gong to be change he said walters death will not be in vain after the service pallbearers gently lifted scotts casket into the hearse crowds poured from the church a slowmoving procession of black cars then made its way to live oak memorial gardens in charleston for the private burial chris stewart an attorney for the scott family said the death represented more than an race issue its a human issue he said were getting emails from people in arkansas telling us im a white male and im supporting this family their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other on friday night scotts open casket was draped with an american flag and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in charleston a dallas cowboys banner  his favorite nfl team  was placed outside the casket and a figurine of a cowboys player stood at his side but scotts family was missing they needed privacy said charleston mayor joseph riley who attended a week ago scott was killed in north charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight a passerby caught the shooting on cell phone video and officer michael slager was swiftly charged with murder he was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted who was walter scott the video shows scott running from an officer who fires eight shots scott is struck five times he falls to the ground nothing in this video demonstrates that the officers life or the life of another was threatened national urban league president marc morial said the question here is whether the use of force was excessive but one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting and at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up on thursday gwen nichols told cnns brian todd that she saw scott and slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot it was like a tussle type of thing like you know like what do you want or what did i do type of thing nichols said i didnt hear mr slager saying stop  nichols account has similarities to slagers he had told investigators that he had tussled with scott over his taser and that he feared for his safety a timeline of events  criminal defense attorney paul callan said he believes slagers defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting  that this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation a physical altercation with a suspect callan said and that would constitute manslaughter under law as opposed to murder and it makes a huge difference in sentencing in south carolina a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation but the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video feidin santana paints a different picture he was walking to work when he saw slager on top of scott he said who was on the ground santana said he could hear the sound of a taser in use he said he didnt see scott go after the taser as slager initially claimed he said he believes scott was trying to get away mr scott never tried to fight santana said neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video because santana started recording shortly after that investigators from the south carolina law enforcement division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start it said in a statement we believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter division chief mark keel said in a statement the cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions slagers lawyer andy savage has complained that he has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has savages office said in a statement that it has yet to receive any investigative documents audio or video tapes other than a copy of mr slagers arrest warrant the news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that slager belongs to is no longer involved in the case charleston county sheriff al cannon said slagers wife jamie who is eight months pregnant and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center friday  slager was being held in isolation and being monitored for his mental health cannon said in a statement one of slagers lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour his wife and mom were tearful but strong and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person even if separated by a thick pane of glass the statement said they held up family photos  and even jamies ultrasound from earlier that day  to remind him of all those who love him throughout the visit michael was focused on jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families a second video taken from a police dash cam has also emerged from the day scott died it shows moments before  the shooting when things seemed to be going smoothly between scott and slager scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle and slager returns to his car to do paperwork then scott gets out of the car and runs out of the cameras frame scott was the subject of a bench warrant over 1810443 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop according to court records that was why he ran lawyers for the family said after the funeral service us rep james clyburn dsouth carolina told reporters outside the service that scott lost a 35000ayear job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support he said it was the best job hes ever had clyburn said now you have to ask  if you want to collect child support theres got to be income and you aint going to make much income from jail it seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom on friday afternoon police met with a man who was in scotts car but the passengers name wasnt in a police report obtained by cnn he was detained briefly after the shooting one officer wrote in the report scott family attorney chris stewart said he was a coworker and friend but he did not identify the passenger by name on friday a few mourners trickled into the fielding home for funerals a white banner with a blue star near scotts casket displayed his favorite nfl team it said tradition the cowboys way this is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our

permanent actions if any would be taken against indonesia this is a dark moment in the relationship but im sure the relationship will be restored he said one of the mens indonesian lawyers todung

respected we also respect other countries legal sovereignty foreign minister retno marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response this is a legal case this is not a political case so at this very stage we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from canberra he said six other inmates were executed including nigerians raheem salami silvester obiekwe

expressing deep sadness at gulartes execution saying that brazilian president dilma rousseff had urged her indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his psychiatric condition gularte is the second

announced that nine prisoners would be executed but at the last moment filipina mary jane veloso was spared we are so happy so happy i thought i had lost my daughter already but god is so good thank you to everyone who helped us her mother celia veloso told cnn philippines embassy officials said veloso would be returned to yogyakarta prison in central java later on wednesday no reason was given

the fact that both this week received a court date of may 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge on tuesday lawyers for the men also said indonesias judicial commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing they said three of the mens indonesian lawyers had been summoned to attend the commission on may 7 however before the

first lets start with his passion for gliders glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor the sport involves teamwork interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety im a glider pilot participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent second lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through lufthansas flight program a requirement of germanwings employment the selection process is most likely highly competitive requiring aboveaverage aptitude is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed regardless the process had to be a stressful experience opinion germanwings and the stigma of mental illness  once accepted into the flight program a rigorous training period began for primary training lufthansa utilizes an ab initio from the beginning program based at a facility the airline owns in goodyear arizona near phoenix the training is geared toward a multicrew pilot license or mpl recognized by the international civil aviation organization the purpose of an mpl is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers countries that dont have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license airline pilots in the united states are not licensed in this manner requiring as much as 1500 hours to qualify as a copilot this is a fairly recent change in faa regulations initiated as a result of the 2009 colgan airlines crash in buffalo new york lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror as a 21yearold flight instructor i had that much flight time it hardly qualified as a lot of experience as with all of the mpl programs the training involves an intense period of airlinespecific instruction and to add insult to injury candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride regardless the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about 76000 using both actual flight experience in a singleengine airplane and simulator time the student receives about 250 hours of training it is a period of almost constant supervision aside from observing and checking performance criteria wouldnt at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment and wouldnt a fellow trainee have noticed also according to reports lubitz took a leave from his training  a very untypical behavior was that not in and of itself a red flag  wouldnt a manager in lufthansas flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues after all the selection process was most likely highly competitive with other qualified candidates readily available once the primary training in arizona was complete lubitz would have returned to germany and completed more specific schooling on the airbus a320 he was about to fly again no one observed issues but even more curious according to reports lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to lufthansa over the course of a career an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues even if we have never flown with a particular individual experience allows us the intuition to know when something isnt quite right that determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines or perhaps through a simple conversation in that regard i find it difficult to believe that none of lubitzs colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time as supplemental background germanwings had been established as the lowcost alter ego carrier of lufthansa depending upon a pilots monthly flight time salary for pilots can be as much as 20 lower than the mainline carrier in addition more days on duty were part of a germanwings crew members schedule apparently as late as march 20 lufthansa pilots had been on strike one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires perhaps enough of a disparity existed for germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered lubitzs absence regardless all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27yearold man the world knows the end result it just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen could it have been prevented well this is the primary purpose of accident investigation never allow the same tragedy to occur again",

hold she and her family  all nine of them  are trying to get comfortable in theyre squeezed in with two other families on the ground by my feet munas middle grandchild is sleeping curled up beside an oil drum theres nowhere to sleep theres no food  you can see how people are just thrown around all over the place she said muna is from buffalo in upstate new york her family is among the dozens of americans caught in the crossfire of  warring parties in yemen and although many other countries evacuated their citizens india most notably ferrying out around 5000 the united states has said it is too dangerous for them to directly evacuate american nationals for more than three weeks neighboring saudi arabia has been conducting airstrikes in yemen they want to drive out the shiite houthi rebels whose opposition to the government grew from protests to a takeover of government buildings and some territory at one time the houthis held yemens president under house arrest before he escaped and fled the bombings have decimated some cities including aden and foreigners find themselves trapped i was there when the indians picked up 200 of their people from the port it was embarrassing we were just sitting there waiting for someone to come and say ok where are the americans lets pick them up  she said i called the riyadh embassy she adds referring to the us embassy in neighboring saudi arabia i told them there were about 75 families here waiting at the port my family has been waiting there for two weeks we ran out of money we ran out of food the state department said it is too risky to conduct an evacuation of citizens from the area we have to make a decision based on the security situation and what is feasible to do state department spokeswoman marie harf said earlier this month and given the situation in yemen is quite dangerous and unpredictable doing something like sending in military assets even for an evacuation could put us citizen lives at greater risk a group of us organizations including the council on americanislamic relations and the americanarab antidiscrimination league have filed a lawsuit against the state department and defense department over the governments stance on evacuations it was purely coincidence that led to muna being on board this ship a wooden vessel chartered by cnn to reach the port city of aden in yemen muna was visiting her sick father in aden when fighting broke out around her with the houthi forces to the north and the waters of the gulf of aden to the south the city is essentially besieged it took us over 30 hours of travel  and a lull in the fighting  for us to be able to dock at one of adens smaller ports she has a nice normal life in new york and said she couldnt wait to get back our ship was the first the port had seen in over a week we agreed to take back 60 refugees  including 15 americans  who had gathered at the ports gate when news of our arrival spread but of course thats nowhere near enough so many more are desperate to leave i asked muna what life in aden was like my daughterinlaw would crouch down and hide in the kitchen she recalls it was just bombs all the time gunshots people running down the street she trails off into silence for everyone here with us on the boat there are families left behind mothers and fathers daughters and sons the first night on board our boat had an almost festive air our new passengers were laughing and sharing cigarettes euphoric at their escape one woman though was sitting alone on deck and i realized she was crying she told me her 15yearold son was trapped on the other side of one of the many front lines that are now etched into the citys streets theyd waited for 10 days but neither her son nor her parents could cross over to the port in al tawahi district too scared to risk missing the boat and endangering the lives of their other three children her husband had convinced her to board when they called to tell her son he also had news for them hed joined the fight against the houthi forces for muna her ordeal ended at djibouti port where christina higgins the us deputy chief of mission was among the embassy staff waiting to meet them i asked higgins about the sense of abandonment muna and many of the other americans trapped in yemen said they felt we have one of the branches of al qaeda thats especially active theres the houthis  neither of these two groups friendly to us citizens weve had to weigh very very carefully what is the safest way the best way for us to help them higgins said ultimately each us citizen is going to have to judge what is best for themselves and their families for many us citizens thats going to mean sheltering in place for other us citizens were actively working at getting information to them on different avenues for travel out of yemen watching them hand out cookies water and phones to reassure those waiting at home its clear the staff here are overjoyed to have some of their citizens safe and sound there are many more though of course who are still in danger there are no definitive records but the 15 americans on board our ship said they had counted 75 more families waiting in aden port who couldnt afford an exittransport fee being charged to depart aden in this time of crisis the 300aperson fee wasnt an official tax but something that local fishermen were charging to ferry passengers to the boat to board thats 75 more families waiting for another happy coincidence to dock at adens deserted ports",

with women  young old black white asian and latina  working in their gardens taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world clinton who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007 is barely in the video at all appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others im getting ready to do something too im running for president clinton said in the video everyday americans need a champion and i want to be that champion  so you can do more than just get by  you can get ahead clinton often says theres no better time in history to be born female than the present shes now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nations first woman president the challenge for clinton in breaking the highest hardest glass ceiling that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics there are historic numbers of women in congress and the idea of leaning in is a catch phrase among professional women meanwhile the feminism label doesnt seem as charged as it once was  people from beyonce to actor joseph gordonlevitt are identifying as feminist as far as the political culture and culture in general this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office there is a willingness now to promote prowomen messages said jennifer lawless who runs the women  politics institute at american university  people are ready for a woman president  the question is this are they ready for hillary as that woman according to a recent pew poll nearly three quarters of americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime but that hope splits along partisan  not gender  lines only 20 of republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70 of democratic women do interactive hillary clinton tries again  in the runup to her announcement and at womencentered events clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song im every woman and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer she has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough she has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter charlotte as the reason she wants to remain in public life a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in iowa this week with small events she made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state as detailed in her book hard choices her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women with clinton in a blue cloth coat holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on the emphasis on women  and the progress of women  as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy which stressed experience and competence over history but the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasnt possible and didnt make for good politics she is the gender card  she doesnt need to play it because she embodies it she is the woman candidate she has shared womens experiences being a mom and a grandmother said democratic pollster celinda lake  she will just naturally bring it in if she overplayed it which she wont it could backfire republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the obama years  the wayne lapierre the national rifle associations president put it this way at the groups recent annual meeting eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough speaking on cnns state of the union sunday tennessee rep marsha blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didnt think it would be clinton theres a couple of things there trust honesty  those get in her way blackburn said as we talk about the polling that is out there that gets in hillarys way and shes not authentic in 2014 democratic candidates such as former colorado sen mark udall proved that the war on women style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits udall lost that race and picked up the nickname mark uterus along the way for his incessant focus on womens issues and democrats found that in states such as texas kentucky and georgia white married women and white working class women tended to prefer republicans katie packer gage who has been talking to women in focus groups about clintons run said that to many women the idea of hillary is more popular than the reality she starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth said packer gage who runs burning glass consulting a firm that coaches republicans on appealing to women voters you do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women but thats a narrow campaign not a winning campaign  you arent going to win 100 of women among republicans former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina might mount a challenge to clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first ladys strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men fiorina released a facebook video sunday in which she said clinton was a highly intelligent woman but doesnt have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness shes not the woman for the white house fiorina said and among democrats former virginia sen jim webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man a demographic that he has said is left out of the democrats increasingly diverse tent kentucky gop sen rand paul who launched his presidential campaign last week has noted that the clinton foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women suggesting that the prowoman framing wont be an easy sell but clinton will have some highprofile champions moments after her announcement top democrats rolled out endorsements including barbara mikulski the first democratic woman elected to the senate in her own right whoopee hillary is off and running she wrote in a statement im ready for hillary and america is ready for hillary she is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all at a recent emilys list event before announcing her run clinton asked her supporters dont you someday want to see a woman president in that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes but its unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches after all the answer across the country is much more complicated",

of the task awaiting a country struggling to come to terms with devastation and tragedy the main highway that heads east out of kathmandu shows massive cracks the tarmac torn apart by the force of saturdays huge tremor one lane is bisected by gaping halfmeter 15 feet fissures theyve been filled in with rubble and dirt allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts it takes an age though picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community ravi opi it is only 30 kilometers 20 miles east of kathmandu but the journey takes almost two hours  and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go the community is off the main highway down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields they farm corn here and millet and vegetables compared to the capital and the regions west of kathmandu and closer to the epicenter the people here were relatively lucky still passing through villages its clear that damage has been suffered in ravi opi a village official walks quickly by telling us over his shoulder that 90 of the houses are currently uninhabitable some are still standing but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides maili tamang 62 is alive but surveys the desolation the quake has wreaked on her life we find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband shes petite and frail but hardened by life her leg bandaged and suppurating is stretched out in front of her she periodically flicks at the flies that have settled on the blood and pussoaked dressing i just want to cry all i feel is hurt  she says showing us where she was the moment the earthquake struck tamangs house was one of the bigger ones in this region a rare twostory structure she and her husband built it together a lifetime ago he died years ago but her extended family lived here with her until saturday she along with her daughterinlaw were indoors when the quake struck and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment the younger woman trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her eventually clawed her way out she was transported by motorbike  few here have motorized transportation most walk  to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village 12 kilometers 74 miles away from here now she is back wondering what the next step for her is throughout this region there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads there is little sign of aid having made it out here out of necessity people are back working their fields near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed elsewhere in ravi opi other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster mahesh koiraba 31 lost his only daughter prati in the quake who was killed as their house collapsed she was 2 years old he was working when the quake hit tilling the fields like so many in kavre and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor i started digging with my hands he says still very much in shock but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home and i saw her blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts all he has left now is a picture in his phone a chubbyfaced toddler wearing oversized sunglasses as rain starts falling  soon turning into torrents and further hampering recovery efforts  we huddle with four families who have been displaced theyre in a makeshift ramshackle shelter crowded with frightened people i ask one of the young women osminda koirale with me if she has seen any sign of outside help no no government has any support for us no one has come out to see that were living like this she said it was terrifying and the future no less so our house is gone now we dont know where we sit what we eat we dont have any clothes all our clothes are inside we cant go inside our houses there was a creeping sense that the worst was over until another powerful aftershock overnight we are not safe  we are so scared osminda tells me and all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital there are parts of nepal so remote it takes days to reach under normal circumstances  there are villages here that one can only reach on foot and it is those areas that were hardest hit these are the places where aid has yet to arrive and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded arwa damon reported from kavre district in nepal and euan mckirdy wrote from hong kong ",

for the humanitarian group world vision told cnn from gorkha district northwest of kathmandu nepal struggles to cope with international aid  nepali home ministry joint secretary sagar mani parajuli

of them jamie mcgoldrick the un resident coordinator for nepal told a news conference tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because kathmandus international airport which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park is log jammed the united nations is aware of the request for tents he said but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of nepal some 14 million need food aid mcgoldrick added nepals population is about 31 million at

challenges getting help to them some of those villages  several years ago before there was vehicle transport  used to take seven days to reach roads are shut now to some of those villages so we can

        "article": "cnn sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me jesus tells the rich man in one of his bestknown parables it was a mantra he invoked repeatedly the poor were blessed and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the welltodo to enter paradise  meanwhile jesus told his twelve apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support so how did this wandering band of  firstcentury evangelists support themselves clearly money was a concern and not just as an impediment to salvation in the new testament money gets 37 mentions while gold gets 38 citations silver merits 20 and copper four coin comes up eight times and purse and denarii  the roman currency  get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the new testament  as the gospel of john tells it six days before passover jesus was in bethany at the house of his friend lazarus whom he had raised from the dead a woman named mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining jesus she dries his feet with her hair an irresistible image for artists and dramatists judas iscariot objected to the act why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor judas asks though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer jesus told judas to leave her alone and foreshadowing his fate said the anointing would be useful for his burial and besides you always have the poor with you  but jesus would not always be there what that passage makes clear is that the jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive so how much i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level rabbi joshua garroway a professor of early christianity and the second commonwealth at hebrew union college in los angeles jesus and his disciples walked wore what they had slept outside or in stayed in friends homes they ate what they caught or what others shared i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of jesus and the companions with whom he traveled garroway said garroway said that it was possible even likely that jesus and his followers received donations from supporters and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite  or perhaps because of  his preaching on the perils of wealth the gospel of luke gives us a glimpse of how jesus ministry functioned on a practical level  soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out  and joanna the wife of herods steward chuza and susanna and many others who provided for them  out of their resources so according to luke women whom jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their resources with mary magdalene and joanna capturing our attention  one by virtue of her husband and the other by her stature in the story of jesus joanna was an upperclass woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of herod antipas the son of herod the great the violent and ambitious head of judea as part of this volatile but powerful household joanna would be uniquely positioned to help jesus with her resources being both wealthy and having palace connections she attends to him during his life and the gospels tell us after his death as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty with her on that morning is mary magdalene also identified as  among other things  a financial supporter of jesus mary likely came from the prosperous town of magdala on the sea of galilee as home to a thriving fishing industry as well as dye and textile works mary could well have come from an affluent family  or have been a successful business woman herself mary magdalene was free to travel the country with jesus and his disciples so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home and in finding jesus we examine the gnostic gospel of mary magdalene and explore the argument that jesus was in fact her husband she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message and messenger not only was mary magdalene one of jesus most devoted followers who stuck with him all the way from galilee to jerusalem from the ministry to the cross and the tomb but also she provided for him from her own means said mark goodacre a professor of new testament and christian origins at duke university when the gospels speak of her ministering to jesus they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in jesus everyday mission goodacre continues along with other women like joanna and susanna she was one of those who made his mission viable along with these women men like joseph of arimathea and nicodemus both men of stature and wealth may have chipped in to help fund jesus ministry the gospels reveal that both these men were rich and supported jesus  indeed it was joseph who removed jesus from the cross on good friday anointing his body with the help of nicodemus and placing him in the tomb that joseph had reserved for himself after the resurrection on that first easter sunday the movement jesus started grew exponentially and the churchs relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater michael mckinley is coauthor with david gibson of finding jesus faith fact forgery six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels",

intuition he was authoritative but not pedantic dignified but not pompous and never spoke unless he had something to say he was so popular that many humorists strove to imitate him so distinctive that none ever quite got him right the bbcs cricket correspondent jonathan agnew agreed he was quite simply peerless nobody else had his authority popularity and skill agnew said in a column on the bbc website if you speak to any broadcaster from any sport they will point to richie as the standardbearer australian national team coach darren lehmann said benaud set an incredibly high standard on and off the field the fact that australia never lost a series under his captaincy says so much and those standards were just as high when he turned his attention to calling the game he told cricketcomau

he is going to deploy his taser after an undercover weapons sting on april 2 but then shooting eric courtney harris in the back with a handgun in a written statement tulsa county district attorney stephen a kunzweiler said bates is charged with seconddegree manslaughter involving culpable negligence its a felony charge that could land the volunteer deputy in prison for up to four years if hes found guilty scott wood an attorney who represents bates said the shooting was an excusable homicide we believe the video itself proves that it was an accident of misfortune that occurred while deputy bates was fulfilling his duties as a reserve deputy wood said he is not guilty of seconddegree manslaughter investigators efforts to defend bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online harris family is demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality theyre also questioning why the 73yearold bates  the ceo of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy  was on the scene in such a sensitive and highrisk sting operation daniel smolen an attorney representing the harris family said bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time its absolutely mind boggling that you have a wealthy businessman whos been essentially deputized to go play like hes some outlaw like hes just cleaning up the streets he said wood said his client  who had donated cars and video equipment to the sheriffs office  had undergone all the required training and had participated in more than 100 operations with the task force he was working with the day he shot harris but hed never been the main deputy in charge of arresting a suspect wood said but was thrust into the situation because harris ran from officers during the arrest probably in the past four of five years since he has been working in conjunction with the task force he has been on there were in excess of 100 operations or search warrants where he was placed on the outer perimeter wood said he has never been on an arrest team or been the one who is primarily responsible for the capture or the arrest of a suspect he is there more in a support mechanism bates who worked as a police officer for a year in the 1960s had been a reserve deputy since 2008 with 300 hours of training and 1100 hours of community policing experience according to the sheriffs office he was also a frequent contributor to the tulsa county sheriffs office including 2500 to the reelection of sheriff stanley glanz tulsa county sheriffs maj shannon clark denied accusations that bates had paid to play a cop describing him as one of many volunteers in the community who have contributed to the agency no matter how you cut it up deputy bates met all the criteria on the council on law enforcement education and training to be in the role that he was in clark said after the shooting bates told investigators that he was in a state of shock and disbelief after realizing hed fired his gun he also said he believed there was a strong possibility that harris had a gun wood said monday that bates is upset over the shooting obviously he is very upset about what happened he feels badly he said the incident completely took him by surprise he has all the requisite training he is tasercertified and if you watch the video you know he was quite shocked when his gun went off authorities say bates thought he pulled out his taser but inadvertently fired his gun theyve painted harris as a dangerous possibly pcpaddled illegal gun dealer who had recently sold methamphetamine to undercover police and who fled police that day in such a way as to give the impression that he had a gun in his waistband though harris was later determined to be unarmed sgt jim clark of the tulsa police department who has been brought in to review the case excused the behavior of bates and an officer who is heard cursing at harris in the video clark said bates was the victim of something called slip and capture where in a highstress situation a person intends to do one thing and instead does something else its a controversial argument that drew sharp criticism online as soon as police started making it one expert told cnn the claim amounts to junk science its not something thats supported by a testable theory theres no peerreviewed articles that would support this  its not generally accepted by the scientific community said phil stinson an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university so its something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence andre harris told reporters monday that claims his brother was violent and on pcp are false he was nonviolent he was peaceful he was loving he was caring and he was my brother that ill never see again til i see him in heaven harris told reporters accusing the sheriffs office of trying to persuade him not to hire an attorney and quickly make the case go away he added that the shooting of his brother who was africanamerican wasnt a racial matter i dont think this is a racial thing i dont think this has anything to do with race it might have a hint there somewhere  this is simply evil andre harris told reporters monday this is a group of people thats spent a lot of time together spent money together  theyve gotten real comfortable with how they do things which when youre the law i guess you feel like you can do things and get away with it and not get exposed well weve come to expose it weve come to pull a mask off the evil weve come to shine a light on the darkness cnns ed lavandera and jason morris reported from tulsa cnns catherine e shoichet reported from atlanta cnns atika shubert chandler friedman and eliott c mclaughlin contributed

the club later told cnn that the stabbing occurred in front of the fulton houses project down the street 1oak staff was unaware of the incident when it happened as it occurred beyond their view in a different location however 1oaks team assisted mr copeland to their fullest capabilities and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue the statement said the statement continued a review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1oak supervision copeland and a female companion katrine saltara were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward fulton houses where their car was parked said a 1oak spokesperson the spokesperson gave cnn additional details on condition of anonymity because 1oaks legal team had approved only the clubs official statement the suspect who the spokesperson said never entered 1oak stabbed copeland and saltara in front of fulton houses and according to the clubs statement mr copelands driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody charges

        "article": "cnn the marriage apocalypse may be coming talk to any millennial and you can envision an america virtually marriagefree with everyone happily single i did and i do recently i talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater kent state university they came to me for career advice which i gave them but i also picked their brains about politics religion and marriage their views on marriage intrigued me the most cause guess what they dont care what your generation thinks  theyll get married if and when they want i didnt go to college for four years to be a mom 21year old candace monacelli told me theres no housewife degree ive worked my butt off for four years to get this degree you want to use it you want to be successful you want to have that happy part of your life as well jackie demate also 21 agreed i would have a very hard time justifying spending 20000 on a wedding when i could go to europe at first i thought jackie was kidding so jokingly i responded wow some people would say with that attitude you are undermining the moral foundation of this country jackie didnt blink but europe she exclaimed im really looking for a travel buddy and i dont think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone i see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone and i would rather be alone successful and happy than in a relationship where im not happy  im ok being single forever as long as im happy before you berate jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage consider where shes coming from a culture rich in divorce in the united states almost 42 million adults have been married more than once thats up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960 percentagewise that means that among adults who are currently married roughly a quarter 23 have been married before compared with 13 in 1960 what a fine example my generation is not still there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong especially in light of a fascinating pew research report on marriage when asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children 50 of respondents were ok with that and of that 50 66 were adults between 18 and 29 religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons economists are concerned for our collective future studies show marriage is correlated with economic wellbeing though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction a study sponsored by the conservative american enterprise institute says  from an obvious standpoint households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes improving wellbeing on the other hand the study points out people who have money may be more desirable marriage prospects bingo on that point the millennials i talked with prefer their partners to be debtfree and riding high they also dont want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt right now im 21 years old and im thousands of dollars in debt emily crille told me that wasnt something my parents bore and its really hard to plan a wedding or even think about something like that when you owe so much money you dont have a job and you dont have a home i felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes as a child of divorce i never wanted to get married either  until i met my husband at 38 but when i was in my twenties waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority i heard the whispers is there something wrong with her is she selfish unlovable perhaps it is selfish to establish a career travel and have a child on your own or maybe its exactly right scandinavians are just about there according to usa today in norway  82 of couples have their first child out of wedlock the numbers are similarly high for sweden and denmark while many couples marry after having the first or second child its clear marriage in parts of scandinavia is dying the article also points out that norway ranked first and sweden second in the united nations qualityoflife survey for 2004 which rates per capita income education levels health care and life expectancy in measuring a nations wellbeing the usa came in eighth in an effort to understand the joys of sambo the term for living together in scandinavia my producer reached out to mikael anteskog adler a 35yearold man from stockholm sweden to put it short he told us marriage costs money party clothes rings honeymoon trip etc and gives no significant advantages as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation wow fiftyyearold anne lehes from gothenburg sweden told my producer i believe that one reason for many swedes staying single is because this is a secular country so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner and inevitably they get disappointed and then they dont think the whole thing is worth it maybe christina hugosson of uppsala sweden sums it up best the notion that marriage is something that youre pressured into seems horrible to me  marriage should be for love not a matter of expectations routine and everyday practicalities my kent state millennials  true romantics  would agree wholeheartedly with hugossan emily told me as much marriage is about love its not about planning or timing and thats what were all kind of waiting for marriage is about love but you have to be good partners too and as they say sometimes love isnt enough which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse would it be so terrible if we all remained single if i had remained single i thought about it so did my husband we didnt plan to have children what was the point in the end we made a decision based on love and practicality a commitment would not only prove our love but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure eleven years later we have no regrets but we are not you and yours would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with i dos i dont know but i would love to know if you do",

syrians have given up hope of returning home in villages in senegal and elsewhere across west africa young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in europe perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved according to researchers and human rights groups but in 2014 more than 80 of them headed for the libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation from the horn of africa to the atlantic from syria and gaza these wouldbe migrants travel wellestablished smuggling routes along the way they must cross deserts and mountains risk kidnap or robbery are often cheated or left stranded one african migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days a teenage somali who made it to malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come i tell them its 95 sure that you will die he said the international organization for migration iom has tracked the migrant flows through north africa for years eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers escaping an authoritarian government poverty and indefinite military service  a land without possibilities many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention torture or punishment of their families according to a report by the regional mixed migration secretariat rmms in nairobi last year they travel to sudan so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay one eritrean woman told the un refugee agency unhcr this month that she had paid 5000 to reach the mediterranean eritreans and syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to europe last year according to arezo malakooti director of migration research at altai consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns malakooti has recently visited seven countries including libya tunisia and morocco to update her study the push factor is much greater than the pull of europe she says upheavals and instability across much of africa and the middle east  combined with the perception that libyas doors are open  have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach libya worsening repression in eritrea has been one factor she says  while eritreans already in refugee camps in sudan have decided to make a dash for the mediterranean one reason is that other routes  through saudi arabia and to israel  have become more difficult israel has adopted a much tougher approach on wouldbe eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the sinai desert including detention and yemens implosion has cut off that conduit as one eritrean told the humanitarian journal irin last year people were traveling to israel because it was the only way and now theyre traveling to europe because its the only way somalis often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the mediterranean face a perfect storm of crises extreme poverty prolonged insecurity sexual violence and other serious human rights violations lack of access to basic needs such as food medical services healthcare and livelihoods are all contributory factors says the rmms seatossed storm of human misery hits italian shores  the iom told cnn it is seeing a spike in wouldbe migrants from senegal mali guinea and gambia in west africa many reason that libyas chaos is an opportunity border posts are left abandoned the coastline unguarded most west africans make the journey for economic reasons the majority are single men in their twenties populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking often say researchers the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home  perhaps misled by fables of riches malakooti noted in a recent report that unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed but west africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home 400 senegalese were recently repatriated from libya by the red cross and iom malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before frenchled intervention pushed them back joel millman of the iom says theres also been an increase in the number of nigerian christians following this route escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by boko haram another disturbing phenomenon according to malakooti is the trafficking of african women for prostitution to italy through libya while still a small fraction of the overall migration the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in europe rose threefold in 2014 she says why migrants are risking their lives to reach italy  a genevabased group the global initiative against transnational organized crime estimated last year that about half of west african migrants pass through the town of agadez in northern niger a crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving agadez stemmed the flow for a while but gangs from the toubou tribe which controls the crossborder trade developed new routes and raised their prices a migrant might pay as much as 300 to reach southern libya in a truck or pickup according to researchers reliable figures on the numbers passing through agadez are difficult to come by but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2000 and 7000 every month other hubs include khartoum in sudan a waystation for migrants from east africa and tamanrasset in southern algeria where a fake malian passport aids passage algeria has also been a destination for syrian refugees but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes  often through turkey and the greek islands hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in libya for years attracted to jobs as day laborers when moammar gadhafi was in power now they face violence discrimination and religious persecution  and are unable even to remit home what little they earn so at least some are embarking on a journey to europe they never intended to take malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach europe the recent murder of egyptian and ethiopian christians by isiss libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some a similar dynamic applies to syrian refugees initially they remained in lebanon jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict says malakooti now theyve given up or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated  and have decided to try to reach europe and start over within libya the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks according to human rights organizations they cluster in dusty towns such as sabha and qatrun and use what are known as connection houses how is europe going to tackle migrant crisis  those driving migrants to tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast such a journey across the desert to avoid checkpoints might cost a migrant 200 in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries tribal feuds roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler the arrival of the islamic state in iraq and syria isis in libya has further complicated passage in january jihadists killed 14 libyan soldiers near sabha malakooti detects a changing pattern since the syrian conflict began it has injected more money into the smuggling business which has therefore become more organized the more reliable groups can charge more she says some migrants buy a package from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel syrian migrants are relatively better off than west africans and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks or consigned to an inflatable dinghy fearing arrest the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves instead giving a compass or gps device to the migrants who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port as libya becomes more dangerous for migrants other countries on both sides of the mediterranean are looking on anxiously some west

        "article": "cnn it has all the key points youd expect on a birth certificate  babys weight length and date of birth confirmed with an official insignia the difference here is the governing authoritys stamp the islamic state in iraq and syria its one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by isis for isis sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that islamic law the isis documents some shared with cnn by researcher aymenn altamimi give a window into the bureaucracy of the selfdeclared caliphate last summer isis fighters swept through the iraqi city of mosul once they took power leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume so they quickly reopened the university of mosul albeit under a radically altered curriculum notices went out that classes would resume on 24 dhu alhijjah 1435 in the islamic calendar or october 18 2014 in the western calendar about four months after isis overran the city but some subjects would be banned  democracy and political thought also hotel management and tourism and archaeology families flee isis in iraq  the banning of archaeology is not a surprise says altamimi who is a shillmanginsburg fellow at the middle east forum at the interdisciplinary center herzliya in israel we see that reflected in isis destruction of ancient artifacts isis regards preislamic artifacts as relics from the period of ignorance jahiliyah their main concern with archaeology is that it would become a subject turning to idol worship which is strictly forbidden in islam hotel management and tourism may seem strange as first but there are no hotels under isis they have all been taken over and shut down either rented out or become places to house families mosul university still has the same professors and teachers altamimi says but now teachers are subjected to sharia sessions to learn what is and what is not acceptable to isis so they have preserved the prior system but within isis sharia law conditions the isis health department runs hospitals for anyone feeling ill not just wounded fighters it has maternity wards health clinics even a mobile vaccination unit and while an ancient interpretation of religion remains at the heart of rules there is more nuance than was seen in afghanistan and areas still controlled by the taliban this is one thing that distinguishes isis from groups like the taliban which forbids vaccinations  polio is a problem in pakistan because the taliban believes the vaccines are a forbidden substance  but isis is not that primitive says altamimi this is also reflected in education  the taliban forbids all girls education but isis allows girls to go to school albeit in a segregated environment however education for girls is limited to the age of 15 reporting from areas controlled by isis is near impossible but anecdotes of daily life and death do emerge altamimis conclusions on isiss governing principles and methods follow similar findings by the quilliam foundation other researchers and social activists how isis makes and takes money  it is an islamic principle to care for the environment so thats one reason that using explosives to catch fish is banned and a quote from the quran saying property owners should lessen the burden on renters to earn spiritual rewards is used at the start of a document outlining a policy on rent control a general theme for isis is that they try initially when they seize control to portray themselves as more just more fair to the inhabitants than the previous ruler explains altamimi for example in syria the first thing isis did was lower the price of bread this is as much about winning over the population as it is about religious rulings at times such as taking up the case of renters the regime can seem almost benevolent altamimi says if someone does complain especially in syria isis does actually try to deal with it he says thats why theyve been seen by many in syria as imposing order especially in areas where multiple parties rebel factions and the syrian government were previously in control isis control of its territory is absolute  bus schedules show routes from raqqa to mosul and qaim with no acknowledgment of the syriairaq border just the new provinces created by the group for its territory detained isis members speak from iraqi jail  and inside that territory even entertainment is regulated foosball can be played provided there is no gambling and the faces or heads are taken off the figurines to prevent idol worship a fatwa on entertainment goes on to say that chess billiards and other contemporary games do not benefit muslims but may be played if they do not distract from religious obligations  it reaches that conclusion from the quran and other religious teachings thats also part of isis strategy says altamimi one of isiss goals is to present this very religiously learned image showcasing their knowledge of islamic jurisprudence to justify to their following that they are the moral authority  its clear that isis and their religious clerics and scholars are extremely familiar with religious texts and use them to convince and persuade isis followers which also makes them impervious to any religionbased counterargument",

flattened homes buildings and temples causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 1800 people follow the latest coverage of nepal earthquake  whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive  but mostly bodies turned up the injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic ninestory dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake at least 17 people were reported killed on mount everest where the quake caused multiple avalanches a seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area further traumatizing survivors residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety the death toll of 1832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed the loss of life reported so far is really based on the information we have from the main cities lex kassenberg nepal country director for care international told cnn  but if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well the information we received from the field is that 80 of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed the quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years residents are used to earthquakes in nepal and many thought the start of saturdays quake was a tremor until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down the reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise said un secretarygeneral ban kimoon in a statement it is clear that very many lives have been lost an estimated 46 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the nepal earthquake the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said via twitter thirty out of 75 nepal districts were affected by the quake in

states from the nepal quake the quake struck at 1156 am local time 211 am et  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of kathmandu it occurred at a depth of 93 miles which is considered shallow

surrounded by the himalayas siobhan heanue a reporter with abc news australia told cnn she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake several temples collapsed around her she said its not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life heanue said adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe it was utterly terrifying heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple they found 12 bodies unfortunately that search was not fruitful heanue said there were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square this was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake the dharahara tower the landmark ninestory structure was packed with people when it collapsed  heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of dharahara the tower built in 1832 provided visitors with a panoramic view of the kathmandu valley are you in nepal or have loved ones affected please share with us if you are in a safe place kanak masni a journalist in kathmandu told cnn by telephone that this appeared to be the most massive earthquake to hit central nepal since 1934 in that quake which was 81 magnitude and centered near mount everest more than 10000 people were killed thomas nybo a freelance photographer was sitting in a coffee shop in kathmandus thamel district it appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity he told cnn thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub this region is no stranger to earthquakes he said a lot of people had the same feeling this is a tremor it passed when that wasnt the case they were in uncharted territory its basically an unwritten book outside the coffee shop nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a sixstory building one woman said children were trapped beneath rubble we ran over and ran around the rubble and couldnt hear anything he said there was no chance that they survived nearby another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water nybo said a voice was heard coming from the rubble a group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a reenforced concrete wall to reach this guy it took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued nybo said not far away lay the bodies of three or four women who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble he said the streets of kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didnt want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks rob stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in kathmandu when the earthquake struck it felt like it went on forever the california resident said witnesses people are panicked running down to street outside people ran onto the street with the temblor knocking some off their feet a huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car later as they walked around the city an aftershock hit people were screaming and looking around he said there were people clearly shaken upset crying denis mcclean spokesman for the un office for disaster risk reduction told cnn that weak building codes in nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage building codes in kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years he said efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but unfortunately this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the kathmandu valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes chitra thapa 48 a cnn security guard in atlanta said he spoke by telephone with relatives in kathmandu and pokhara a city about 125 miles 200 kilometers west of the capital they

        "article": "cnn debates on climate change can break down fairly fast there are those who believe that mankinds activities are changing the planets climate and those who dont but a new way to talk about climate change is emerging which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one your health its easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations but who wouldnt stop to think  and perhaps do something  about their own health or the health of their children this new way of talking about climate change  and linking it to public health issues  was part of a roundtable discussion tuesday at howard universitys college of medicine president barack obama joined us surgeon general dr vivek murthy and epa administrator gina mccarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of national public health week i think weve always known  or at least in the 20th century weve understood  that environment has an impact on public health the president told cnns dr sanjay gupta i remember when i first went to college in los angeles in 1979 the air was so bad that you couldnt go running outside obama said youd have air quality alerts and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside we took action and the airs a lot better there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home so weve got to do better in protecting vulnerable americans obama continued ultimately though all of our families are going to be vulnerable you cant cordon yourself off from air or climate murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger its also personal to me because ive cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath murthy said  asthma can be very difficult for patients but also for their families the impacts of climate change could make the situation worse this is not just a future threat  this is a present threat said brian deese a senior adviser to the president deese cited a recent study by the american thoracic society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients the good news is that in addition to having doctors and nurses public health officials schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness  and to in some cases impact their practice  they anticipate for example increased asthma instances and plan ahead of time to deal with those obama told gupta what we have is companies like google and microsoft that are going to take data were releasing and start developing apps so that potentially individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a realtime basis communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change said obama the impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors according to the environmental protection agency these factors include the effectiveness of a communitys public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior age gender and economic status of individuals affected the epa says on its website impacts will likely vary by region the sensitivity of populations the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts and societys ability to adapt to change the world health organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 most will likely perish from malaria diarrhea heat exposure and undernutrition around the world variations in climate are affecting in profoundly diverse ways the air we breathe the food we eat and the water we drink writes dr maria neira director of the whos public health and environment department we are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health consider air pollution the single greatest environmental health risk we face in 2012 alone exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people  one in eight deaths worldwide undernutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the worlds poorest regions rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields further compromising food security floods are increasing in frequency and intensity creating breeding grounds for diseasecarrying insects mosquitoborne diseases like malaria are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity what will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable writes neira areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope developing countries will be hardest hit the health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider earths average temperature has risen by 14 degrees fahrenheit over the past century and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years according to the epa small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather the agency warns many places have seen changes in rainfall resulting in more floods droughts or intense rain as well as more frequent and severe heat waves still there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather americans are no more likely today 55 than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring according to a march gallup poll a 2013 time magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on peoples lives the article says this strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided if action is taken early enough the president said what happened with los angeles air proved that point when the clean air act was passed not only was there a terrible smog in los angeles it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country obama said the fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and its been much cheaper than anybody expected because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it as a consequence the american people are a lot healthier in addition to being able to you know see the mountains in the background because its not covered in smog we know how to do this obama said we just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the american people have always displayed",

        "article": "cnn yemeni officials said saudi airstrikes targeting a military base on tuesday hit a nearby school injuring at least a half dozen students the information came from two officials with the governors office in ibb province where the school is located as well as houthi sources from the rebel group that is fighting for control of the country a third source with the education ministry in ibb said three students had been killed at the al bastain school in maitam in southwestern yemen as a result of an airstrike the officials from ibbs governors office said the al hamza military base was targeted because houthis have been sending reinforcements from ibb to nearby provinces there were no casualties on the base the officials said but it was heavily damaged the school which is about 500 meters onethird of a mile from the base was not the main target the officials said schoolchildren were heading to their lunch break when the attacks took place the officials said the incident was another example of what has become evident in recent days the chaos in yemen now the scene of some of the most chaotic fighting in the middle east has left civilians  noncombatants both locals and foreigners  caught in the crossfire those trying to escape the violence either by leaving their homes or by leaving the country altogether have been flung into a vortex of fear fatigue flight and death explosions shattered windows in sanaa the countrys capital the fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks at least 74 children are known to have been killed and 44 children maimed since the fighting began on march 26 unicef said monday in a statement that did not include the children reportedly killed tuesday in maitam separately saudi airstrikes wiped out about a fifth of the armored vehicles recently captured by southern separatists opposing the houthis near aden according to a senior official in the separatist movement the official expressed frustration about the lack of coordination between the saudi military and friendly forces in the region including the antihouthi southern separatists the houthis are also sometimes referred to as southern separatists the saudis have no one on the ground in aden he said calling for the military to work out a means of coordination there is very little coordination the group had recently captured about 100 pieces of mixed armor among the captured weaponry the official said were tanks armored personnel carriers and some large artillery  about 20 pieces were destroyed in the saudi attack that took place near an old oil refinery over the weekend a saudiled coalition smashed parts of yemens defense ministry central command in the capital senior yemeni officials said despite the rain of bombs the houthis still control sanaa but the airstrikes have destroyed much of the citys infrastructure the electricity has gone out on 16 million yemenis living in houthiheld areas the yemeni officials said many fear they will lose access to clean water as well yemenis and foreigners are scrambling to leave passengers carrying duffel bags and plastic sacks stuffed with clothes were seen boarding an air india flight as they hastened to leave the capital some of them sprinted to the plane this was a flight that no one wanted to miss many were not newcomers to yemen damodar thakur a professor at sanaa university had lived in the capital for 34 years i never felt like a foreigner he said he was exhausted by the shelling at night my goodness he said gunshots being fired every minute sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights some women crying children terrified really bad over the last few days india has evacuated 2500 people from yemen said vijay kumar singh the indian deputy foreign minister overseeing the evacuation the flights are going to djibouti a small african nation about 430 kilometers 265 miles away some evacuees are fleeing on boats from port cities such as aden more cars in the streets in aden scared families rushing away in cars with smashed windows  suitcases  mattresses on the roof tweeted robert mardini head of operations for the middle east for the international committee of the red cross why is saudi arabia bombing yemen houthi rebels control sanaa including the airport but because of the airstrike campaign the saudis to some extent control air access so getting people out requires coordination the saudi air force gave air india a fourhour window to go to and from sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing as the air india plane approached the city the crew could see the scars of the fighting there were no cars on the roads dozens of buildings were destroyed at the airport the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by saudi bombs but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits loading of the passengers was swift they approached the planes carrying boarding passes  a touch of normalcy in an otherwise abnormal event they didnt pay for the flight but they had to purchase exit visas from the houthis children sat on their parents laps to maximize the number of people on the plane some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff everyone seemed to carry the weight of war especially nurses who had tended the wounded from djibouti the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations now i can only pray for yemen and those we left behind thakur said whos joining saudi arabias fight against the houthis yemen has descended into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels shiites who complain of being marginalized in the majority sunni country forced president abdu rabu mansour hadi from power the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overran sanaa in january but hadi escaped in february fled to aden and declared himself still president houthis and their allies including those loyal to hadis predecessor then fought hadis forces in the aden area hadi fled aden in late march ultimately for saudi arabia when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city the conflict prompted saudi arabia a predominantly sunni nation and yemens neighbor to the north to intervene with force along with other arab nations the houthis are allied with iran saudi arabias bitter rival across the persian gulf and the saudis do not want an iranian proxy in power on their border at his daily briefing on tuesday saudi brig gen ahmed asiri told reporters that the ties between the rebels and iran were clear he accused iran of training yemeni youths to use military aircraft and weapons after the houthis seized sanaa he said there were 14 flights a week coming from iran carrying weapons and ammunition for the houthi militia the us role in backing the saudis has grown since the bombing campaign began two weeks ago we have expedited weapons deliveries we have increased our intelligence sharing and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the saudi operation center deputy secretary of state anthony blinken said in addition the united states has promised to resupply the saudi weapons stocks used in the last two weeks us defense secretary ash carter emphasized the importance of limiting civilian casualties when conducting airstrikes when he spoke with saudi defense minister prince mohammed bin salman on monday the pentagon said what about sharing intelligence when it comes to identifying targets thats a sensitive issue given the rebels ties to iran and concerns about civilian casualties guidance from us central command stops short of allowing the united states to tell the saudis what targets to bomb according to two us defense officials who confirmed details of the guidance to cnn but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter the guidance allows the united states to review targets the saudis have selected the officials said and advise them if there are civilian areas nearby or other no go spots such as mosques and hospitals cnns samira said joe sheffer and barbara starr contributed to this report",

        "article": "cnn ive been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event as the boston marathon runners begin and hopefully finish their exhausting run monday the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways more public safety officials throughout the route a finish line area that prohibits large bags national guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security  those are the most obvious visible changes  and there are less obvious ones too with the luxury of some time and healing the city has moved on and that is a blessing in the midst of that weeklong tragedy  the bombings the manhunt the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the tsarnaev brothers  we thought we knew what was going on but we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness the fog of war sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions that narrative is just forming and its worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week as a former homeland security adviser for massachusetts i was intimately involved with the marathon planning as a commentator for cnn i saw the story evolve during that week some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight others by various afteraction reports and assessments and others by the trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts on tuesday the trials sentencing phase will begin determining whether he will receive the death penalty in national security circles there is often a debate about whether the us judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials terrorism the argument goes is different from traditional crimes and our system of evidence and crossexamination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats even if this argument were valid in some context  where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain  the boston marathon trial made clear that the system does work what was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional prosecutors presented evidence defense attorneys challenged the witnesses the defendant chose not to testify a verdict was rendered its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases but also took the mythology maybe even the romanticism of terrorism out of the case it rendered tsarnaev a common criminal and that was a statement worth making recent reports about the shootout in watertown that friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt it is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of massachusetts transit police officer richard donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure maybe it was adrenaline maybe it was just the nature of the weapons what is clear  in watertown and in so many other police departments  is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now that is a dangerous gap and too many police departments are failing to address it we have a notion of boston strong coming from the attacks and the citys response i never loved the term mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have puritan stock and a kickass attitude that is only partially true we risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a keep calm persona i have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response the quick decisions to move runners off boylston street the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers it is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only one part of the response that doesnt get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks runners had no access to phones and often had no identification family members of runners often didnt know where their loved ones were on the marathon route first responders in particular the boston police and the red cross focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to commonwealth avenue a few blocks from the finish line once family members know that they are with loved ones the trauma subsides they often leave the scene freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster is my family ok obviously there is so much more to learn could the bombing have been avoided what would have happened if the fbi had shared information it had on the tsarnaev family with local police what if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers its woulda coulda shoulda but still essential one of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isnt simply for blame but to get better for the next time analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient but do not believe that we are done learning looking back can be risky its often called the blinding clarity of hindsight because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror but i have no doubt that at future anniversaries what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written and maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead",

        "article": "cnn german police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near frankfurt a german terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told cnn on thursday german prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the frankfurtarea town of oberursel on suspicion of planning a bostonstyle attack but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target the suspected target according to florian flade the terrorism researcher was a race planned for friday the race loops around eshborn and frankfurt on may day each year attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route prosecutor albrecht schreiber said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition a gun the essential parts of a g3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the west including the 2005 london bombings earlier thursday andreas hemmes a spokesman for the police of west hesse told cnn that the house and car of two individuals in oberursel in the forested hills west of frankfurt had been searched as a result of what had been found police had expanded their search along the l3004 road on the bike race route hemmes said we suspect that there was a salafist background said peter beuth the interior minister for hesse referring to ultrafundamentalist interpretations of islam police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an islamist attack flade a journalist at die welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids told cnn that a german couple of turkish descent  halil and senay d  were under arrest he said the couple had ties to radical islamist circles in the frankfurt area neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group last week german police observed halil d moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living they suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route according to flade flade said that according to german police documents german police first became aware of the couple at the end of march when they went to a garden center near frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide he said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons the first was that the woman was covered in a full veil the second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds furthermore after police thwarted a bomb plot by german extremists trained in the tribal areas of pakistan to kill american servicemen in germany in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxidebased bombs  the socalled sauerland plot  german law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide according to flade after the tipoff german investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were all they had to go on was the surveillance footage the woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape so they did not immediately know who they were but in early to midapril they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couples radical ties according to flade german police established that the couple had recently traveled to spain where they met with members of sharia4spain a radical projihadist group linked to al muhajiroun in the united kingdom spanish police had monitored the meeting in spain they also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with aqim al qaedas north african affiliate  and they found the couple were in contact with a young radical islamist from frankfurt who had gone to fight in syria at the end of last year and was recently killed the pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by boston marathon bombers tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev flade said the device recovered near frankfurt included nails as shrapnel the boston bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in inspire magazine an online engish language magazine put out by al qaeda in yemen which has also been translated into german and other languages in august 2013 the british security agency mi5 revealed to parliaments intelligence and security committee that inspire has been read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the uk since its first issue in 2010 we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots like other european countries germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to syria and iraq in recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in germanys large turkish diaspora community travel to syria is particularly easy for individuals of turkish descent because turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to syria according to flade almost 700 germans are believed to have traveled to syria and iraq with up to 90 joining isis onethird of these have returned to germany and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in syria and iraq there has only been one fatal terrorist attack in germany since 911  the shooting death of two us airmen outside frankfurt airport by a lonewolf radicalized islamist in

12000 feet high open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular freefall stunt geronimo happy 60th birthday to the hercules  the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history lockheed has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary b52 bomber and the famous u2 spy jet unlike those planes the c130 has never become a household name the fact that furious 7 producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the hercules the film makes it appear as if another plane  a c17 globemaster iii  drops the cars but in real life it took a hercules to pull it off shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges said stunt coordinator jack gill in a featurette video about the mission you start throwing all those cars out together  youve got to figure out spacing and these things drop very fast gill said jeremiah beaudin of international air response copiloted the stunt we have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes he says in the video the hercules is big its tough its versatile it refuels helicopters in flight it can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world  and land on short unfinished airstrips at lockheeds marietta georgia factory in 1955 the governor of georgia christened the first production c130a by smashing a bottle of chattahoochee river water across its nose the plane then proceeded to take off from nearby dobbins air force base on tuesday exactly 60 years later georgia gov nathan deal recreated the ceremony  christening a brand new super hercules during a birthday party of sorts for lockheed executives and military dignitaries im told that the 2500th version of this aircraft is now on the assembly line inside this building deal said it transports it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse inside the planes cockpit lockheed test pilot steve knoblock said hes done a lot of airdrop testing while flying c130s weve dropped some crazy things out knoblock said air dropping a car out of an airplane is easy whatever we can fit inside the cargo hold we can drop several factors come into play for a pilot making a drop knoblock said including payload weight wind speed and timing we have to give time for the car to clear the airplane let the parachutes deploy and then actually open he said one tricky decision involves how high the plane drops its cargo theres a trade off  between dropping it low and being more accurate  and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land knoblock also explained how the c130s robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions the pilot gets to decide how hard the touchdowns going to be he said sometimes to get his performance he needs to really let it crunch on the ground but the airplane can handle it meanwhile in the back of the plane lockheed loadmaster lucky madsen showed off the planes new reversible deck which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface  to a floor with rollers embedded in it the rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane the legacy surrounding the hercules has been built by 60 years of successful missions including  in 1989 a flight crew aboard a hercules named teal 57 was credited with saving the crew of a national oceanic and atmospheric administration hurricane hunter airplane while flying through hurricane hugo the noaa plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine teal 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the noaa plane to escape the eye of the deadly category 5 storm everyone returned safely to base in 2012 israeli brig gen joshua shani revealed how he flew a hercules on a successful hostage rescue mission to entebbe uganda four c130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked air france flight in 1976 at some places that were particularly dangerous we flew at an altitude of 35 feet to evade radar trust me this is scary he told idfblogcom during the military build up to 2003s usled invasion of iraq a hercules test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the pentagons arsenal  a socalled moab  known in military circles as the mother of all bombs a c130 ejected the 21000pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above floridas eglin air force base the bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball in the past the air force attached small solidfuel rocket engines to some c130s the added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways the hercules wasnt designed to land on aircraft carriers theyre too short nonetheless a hercules did it  during a test in 1963 thats how amazing this plane is but nothing lasts forever and the c130 is no different the air force has been developing a socalled super short takeoff and landing aircraft that might replace the hercules after 2020 the air force research laboratory calls it speed agile the proposed fourengine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short improvised airfields pentagon planners apparently are hoping to create a herculesinspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century",

day to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day it was so quiet that afternoon  70 years ago on thursday april 12 1945  the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks  the second city editor guy housley was to my left  to my right perhaps 6 feet away the telegraph editor george dodge at 450 the oldfashioned upright candlestick telephone on his desk rang  the direct line the associated press used to alert editors to major news events  he answered replaced the belllike receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular roosevelt is dead the silence of shock until dodge jumped up so quickly his swivel chair crashed into the glassfronted bookcase behind him  a symphonic orchestra cymbals sound  and ran to what was called the tube room with its row of associated press teletype machines housley said clear the decks for action the words had barely cleared his lips when city editor clem lane halfran back into the city room  hal oflaherty director of the daily news foreign service was only a step or two behind  the door of the managing editors office that opened into the city room flew open and managing editor everett norlander joined them around the copy desk where dodge was editing the bulletin lane wheeled toward the rewrite desk  cleveland  get downstairs  get the reaction the main entrance to the chicago daily news building also served as the main entrance to the northwestern railroad terminal with its commuter trains to the north shore communities  a veritable sea of lemmings would be coming up that marble incline for the next hour  not that charlie cleveland could linger the daily news an afternoon newspaper was strictly limited in the hours it could publish  only an hour or so remained for extras i knew clips would be needed and ran to the library the old morgue  theyd heard and had a splay of white envelopes on president franklin d roosevelt  big and bulging  spread out  they had one as i recall  a small one  on harry s truman  i grabbed it and ran back down the corridor bob lewin who usually handled labor stories had been told to do something on the new president  he opened the truman envelope spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the books in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen five sheets of copy paper stapled together with four sheets of carbon paper between  to be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies the top one for the editor a carbon copy for the reporters reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks  lewins eyes moved over the clippings evaluating rejecting selecting deciding what to use  at last he started typing  because of the time pressure the story would be done in short takes two maybe three paragraphs at a time he wrote  the new president  the 33d in the history of the united states  is harry s truman he was automatically elevated to the presidency on the death of president roosevelt truman will be 61 on may 8 lewin ripped the book out of the typewriter roller  i left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to lane back by lewin i read over his shoulder  born in lamar mo trumans political rise was spectacular he was relatively little known outside of his home state when he was elected to the us senate in 1934  he had the backing of the late tom boss prendergast of the kansas city machine this time lewin gave me a nod  i pulled out the book the typewriter roller ratcheting protest after two more takes lane said okay thats it cleveland was back  the cricketlike click click click of typewriter keys at the rewrite desk drew me and i stood by to take his story to lane  word of president roosevelts death struck chicago late this afternoon with numbing suddenness within a few minutes after the bulletins came to the daily news the office switchboards were swamped with calls for verification so great were the number of calls that the lines became clogged and many queries could not be handled many of the callers spoke as if disbelieving the report  as if it were some wildly spread rumor the same kind of uncertainty was noticed in the faces of the crowds thronging homeward   word passed from one to another  did you hear that  roosevelt is dead  is it true clevelands story delivered i returned to the city desk to help with the calls  many as he had mentioned from people wanting to know whether it was true but some from reporters and beat men whod been heading home reporting the reaction where they were a copyboy rushed around the room dropping off copies of the first extra  the simple news in a 76pointtype headline roosevelt dead  statements began coming in from local officials and civic leaders a few phoned in but most from the city news bureau which served the chicago newspapers with local news as the wire services did with national news  i sorted through the multiple copies separating them into evergrowing stacks the second extra was dropped off  roosevelt dead   with the subhead dies at 63 of hemorrhage in georgia  the last extra had a threecolumn photo of roosevelt edged in black a twocolumn of truman and a story on the presidents death and funeral plans as the editors talked i heard one ask what kind of president do you think hell make  and oflaherty director of the daily news foreign service said if theres anything to the american system the man will rise to the office ive thought of that through the years as truman has risen in the opinion of presidential historians  the atom bomb  the marshall plan  the berlin airlift  the truman doctrine  recognition of the state of israel  desegregation of the armed services  ordering us forces to oppose the invading forces when north korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded south korea then organizing a united nations army  firing douglas macarthur i continued to sort the statements from officials  lane asked me to take one set down to lloyd lewis the chief editorial writer had a corner office at the far end of the long office corridor  i found him sitting in the dark looking out the window at the chicago skyline  sensing my presence he said i wonder what the world will be like without him i dont know sir  in the dusk the quiet i suspect he didnt expect an answer but i thought about franklin delano roosevelt who served in the white house for an unprecedented 12 years  hes the only president i can remember he turned saw me in the doorway a teenager in penny loafers a cardigan sweater and a pleated plaid skirt and said with a nod of course i gave him the statements and updated him on the latest news  the funeral train will bring his body up from georgia  to washington i mean the next morning i turned to the editorial page to see what hed written lewis took his cue from roosevelts address to a joint session of the congress following his trip to yalta  the headline  it has been a long journey  i trust you will agree it has been a fruitful one note an earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted fdrs age in the chicago daily news subhead he was

local officials say the city is much safer and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to juarez this month the city launched the tourism campaign juarez is waiting for you the rebranding effort started quietly a year ago and on april 10 it was on full display mayor enrique serrano officially kicked off the campaign giving what he called an unprecedented highprofile tour to regional leaders from the united states and mexico us rep robert beto orourke of texas was one of those on a leg of the juarez tour his congressional district includes el paso texas which sits directly across the rio grande orourke says theres good reason for locals to be hopeful as a region el paso and juarez represent 20 of all usmexico trade the binational ties are strong and have remained strong orourke says yes we had a really difficult time for a  period juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world orourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men women and children were killed indiscriminately many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence others were victims of the drug turf war it wasnt that long ago orourke says that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into juarez now i travel to juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go i always feel safe and secure a spokesman for the chihuahua state attorney generals office told cnn that at one point there were days when juarez had more than 20 killings that was normal spokesman julio castaneda told cnn its safer now the numbers from the attorney generals office seem to bear that out more than 3000 people were killed in the city just four years ago but so far this year there have been 89 killings according to castaneda  a dramatic decrease in the violence undoubtedly the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions and specifically the local police helped there was a coordinated effort between agencies castaneda said without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city the government cleaned up corruption within the local police force and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels another factor that may have helped the turf war between the juarez and sinaloa cartels essentially ended with the sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in juarez orourke argues that the el pasojuarez border is safer than its ever been he cites the 30 million lawful crosses from el paso into juarez last year as a symbolic step yet there are those who dont want to celebrate too soon for juarez to be considered a safe city theres a long way to go says sergio meza executive director for plan estrategico de juarez an independent organization that works to improve the citys quality of life just this past year in 2014 there were 424 homicides in 2007 there were 272 yes were not as bad but were still very sick meza told cnn from his office in juarez in reality were progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity were still working out the corruption in the city its still an issue here with more than 40 of juarez living below the poverty line according to plan estrategico de juarez the future of the city will depend on the peoples participation in public matters in fact the organizations slogan is nothing is fixed alone participate we are looking at a compromised future meza said we dont talk about that we dont have the money to generate work here one bright spot us investment is making a comeback american companies delphi honeywell flextronics and lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in juarez over the last year that hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago but with the average salary at 20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores or factories along the usmexico border in juarez meza says more needs to be done the scars from the recent past remain several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti americans who before the violence came to juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence but in a sign of progress the us state department amended its travel warning for the city while it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution its no longer telling people not to come longtime residents of juarez and neighboring el paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed in the last year however they have definitely noticed that life is back i measure it by the everyday coming and going of people gustavo reveles 39 told cnn for someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis its encouraging to be crossing back to juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen reveles lived in juarez until he was 15 and now lives in el paso he says the threat of violence is still a little bit concerning though that hasnt stopped him in recent weeks from going to juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks things have changed he said to go through what juarez went through you see life there again you see a semblance of what was there before to really recover and heal wounds theres a long way to go but the process has started and thats a step in the right direction cnnmoneys octavio blanco contributed to this report",

disease was fed paltry amounts of food faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body and was never allowed outside only the end of world war ii brought her relief lee is just one example of the over 200000 women from korea china the philippines indonesia and other asian nations who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the japanese imperial army during world war ii these socalled comfort women suffered unimaginable physical emotional and psychological trauma when japanese prime minister shinzo abe addresses a joint meeting of congress on wednesday he has an opportunity to do right by these women and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology  something that carries the weight of his government in 2007 in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address the house of representatives sent a profound message to the japanese government by unanimously passing house resolution 121 which i authored the resolution called on the japanese government to formally acknowledge apologize and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its imperial armed forces coercion of young women into sexual slavery publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the comfort women never occurred and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime we are still waiting for their government to comply in 2006 during his first term prime minister abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the comfort women system and during his second term abe and his rightwing allies have continued to question history  even trying to dilute and rewrite it last year i along with 17 of my house colleagues wrote to the japanese ambassador to the united states calling the timing and contents of the japanese government report on the 1993 kono statement regrettable unfortunate unacceptable and destabilizing last year meanwhile the abe administration tried and failed to get the united nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report which called on japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery most notably earlier this year the japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in us history textbooks about the comfort women some say that japan has already apologized enough and its time to move on to those people i say in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history for every step forward the japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation it takes two steps back as someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant i know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts in 1942 during world war ii my government put aside the constitutional rights of japanese americans and systematically incarcerated 120000 of us we were us citizens but merely because of our ancestry the government treated us like the enemy decades later we the japanese american community fought for an apology from our government in 1988 congress passed and president ronald reagan signed into law the civil liberties act which was a formal apology to united states citizens of japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during world war ii our government made a mistake but they apologized for it and healed many wounds as a result japan must now do the same it must show the maturity of a democratic country apologize for its mistake and thereby gain the trust of her sister asian nations the german chancellor angela merkel has urged prime minister abe to face japans history germany knows something about this after world war ii germany engaged in a painful national coming to terms with the past that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal time is of the essence today there are fewer than 100 surviving comfort women across the asiapacific each year this number declines ms lee is one of 53 remaining korean survivors the survivors are dying by the day they deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years the opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies i will be in the house chamber when prime minister abe delivers his address ms lee will attend as my guest both of us hope the prime minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally and firmly apologize and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly ms lee and her sisters deserve no less",

than people who dont get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities mchenry showed that she either forgot those golden rule lessons from childhood or that she hasnt really lived her life with that mantra mchenry has since apologized on twitter saying she said some insulting and regrettable things and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in virginia  she should always choose to be respectful and take the high road but its not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker i see this britt mchenry video and think its not just about how a celebrity shouldnt act in public its how all of us shouldnt act wrote cait on twitter said shannon also on twittter i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but  now i know shes the kind of woman i hope ive taught my daughters not to be her language and disdain brings shame on her her profession and her employer people dont all of sudden have such a vile tirade this comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors lets let her be an example to others wrote c cooper on a changeorg petition asking mchenrys employers to fire her the mchenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her this morning i told her mchenry was suspended for a week by espn and that led to another conversation my kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to treat other people the way you would want them to treat you even in uncomfortable moments celebrity apologies the good bad and uncomfortable  so britt mchenry check out these examples of how the rich famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity after british journalist katie hopkins seriously fatshamed pop music star kelly clarkson saying a host of insulting things about the singers weight clarkson won praise for her graceful response thats because she doesnt know me im awesome it doesnt bother me its a free world say what you will ive just never cared what people think she said a college baseball player gets suspended for calling little league baseball phenom mone davis a slut her response she emailed bloomsburg university asking that the college reinstate him everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance davis the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in little league world series history told espn  i know right now hes really hurt and i know how hard he worked to get where he is i mean i was pretty hurt on my part but i know hes hurting even more when an argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to pope francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the countrys president ahead of the general election in october and possibly influencing the outcome what did the pope do well he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation the pope appears to have been more than graceful because after the conversation the journalist pledged to learn how to pray when queen bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lipsynching the national anthem in honor of president obamas inauguration in 2013 she didnt come out swinging instead she admitted to singing along with her prerecorded track at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring a cappella rendition of the national anthem finally reese witherspoon may be the closest example for mchenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode when witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence the academy award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as do you know who i am and youre about to find out who i am she ultimately issued an apologetic statement and then went on morning television to apologize some more we went out to dinner in atlanta and we had one too many glasses of wine and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not she said on good morning america its completely unacceptable and we are so sorry and embarrassed we know better and we shouldnt have done that and she added when a police officer tells you to stay in the car you stay in the car i learned that for sure she told the gma host  now did mchenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry you never berate them for their weight job appearance and income lets hope so can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook",

        "article": "cnn rebekah gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict it had been almost two years since dzhokhar tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the boston marathon setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others in court last month she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street staring at her own bones now jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath but no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain she said i dont believe that there will ever be justice brought to this no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life she said crying as she spoke to reporters outside her texas home i do believe however that he should be held accountable for his actions and im very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that gregory who wrote a widely publicized letter to tsarnaev after testifying said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories but its an important step everything is being brought up again full force our lives will never ever be the same but i hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason that theres a bigger plan she said i may be standing on one fake leg but im standing here stronger than ever because someone tried to destroy me and he failed for gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack wednesdays verdict brought a mix of emotions from triumphant vows to move forward to expressions of gratitude to debate over whether tsarnaev should be sentenced to death there were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in boston in fact there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats as tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head some survivors and victims family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears as cnns alexandra field noted from inside the courtroom theyve waited a long time for this the family of sean collier a 26yearold police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology said tsarnaev and his brother tamerlan were terrorists who failed monumentally in striking fear in people while todays verdict can never bring sean back we are thankful that dzhokhar tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families the collier family said in a written statement to richard dic donohue an mbta police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the tsarnaevs in watertown the verdicts show that as a society  terrorism will not prevail and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation justice has been served today donahue tweeted survivor karen brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal she doesnt believe dzhokhar tsarnaevs brother tamerlan now dead persuaded him to take part in the plot as the defense contended dzhokhar in her view was all in obviously we are grateful for the outcome today brassard tolder reporters its not a happy occasion but its something that we can put one more step behind us that sense of turning the page was echoed by bruce mendelsohn who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line the verdicts mean that dzhokhar tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect  he is now officially a convicted killer you cant call it celebration but there is a newfound peace of mind at least in and around boston this was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt and they got through it by rallying around each other a deep bond reflected in the mantra boston strong that feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by wednesdays verdict and its evident in people like heather abbott who lost her left leg below the knee since then shes become a living example of someone who wasnt stopped by the terror  learning not only to walk again but to run again nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever abbott said wednesday on facebook but at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken that view was commonly shared for those hurt  physically mentally emotionally  by the horrors of 2013 wednesday was key to their progression but its not the end of the road just ask jeff bauman the picture of him bloodied being rushed through the streets of boston by good samaritan carlos arredondo became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack even after losing both his legs bauman has become a symbol since of resilience  moving on with his life by marrying and fathering a child on wednesday bauman said the verdict will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed but it is a relief he added and one step closer to closure cnns ann

        "article": "washington cnn as the missouri national guard prepared to deploy to help quell riots in ferguson missouri that raged sporadically last year the guard used highly militarized words such as enemy forces and adversaries to refer to protesters according to documents obtained by cnn the guard came to ferguson to support law enforcement officers whom many community leaders and civil rights activists accused of using excessive force and inflaming an already tense situation in protests that flared sporadically from august through the end of the year the national guards language contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a freedom of information act request is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers actions in putting down riots they broke out after the august 9 shooting of unarmed black teenager michael brown by city police officer darren wilson a grand jury declined to indict wilson in the case its disturbing when you have what amounts to american soldiers viewing american citizens somehow as the enemy said antonio french an alderman in st louis the documents obtained by cnn also detail that the missouri national guard was concerned about perceptions of its deployment with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters and the communications show them calibrating the timing of their deployment in november  in anticipation of the st louis county grand jurys decision on whether to indict wilson  to try to ensure that their presence didnt further dial up tensions though several community members voiced concern that they were not deployed quickly enough we are deliberately constraining mobilization timelines to the last couple days to minimize backlash from calling up the ng early col david boyle army chief of staff at the missouri national guard informed his officers in a nov 18 email we have coordinated for lower profile less confrontation likely mission sets to emphasize support roles and minimize public militarization perception additionally some in the national guard seemed worried the language in the mission briefings could be problematic days before the announcement of the grand jurys decision an email from boyle warned of potential consequences from using language that could be construed as potentially inflammatory two days after that notification was sent to commanding officers stating that all reference of enemy were changed to state criminal elements still national guard spokesman capt quinn defended the militarized language as standard for the planning process ahead of deployment in an email to cnn he said the documents used in the ferguson mission briefings were a generic military planning format utilized in a wide range of military missions so the term enemy forces would be better understood as potential threats often in guard operations threats would include inclement weather heat failing levees etc in further comments emailed to cnn late friday after the initial version of this article appeared quinn insisted that while the term enemy forces appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission and claimed that the language was changed well ahead of the grand jurys decision but internal communications from as early as aug 14 through nov 18 when the directive was issued to change the inflammatory language show numerous uses of the terms that were sent to a large number of national guard commanders and leadership though the national guards actions throughout the fall did not elicit the type of complaints that were directed at the police some in ferguson were displeased that the guardsman didnt do more to act against looters and vandals ferguson mayor james knowles criticized the guard at a november 25 news conference saying that unfortunately as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed the national guard was not deployed in enough time to save all our businesses quinn in his comments to cnn responded that it would not have been part of the national guards mission to confront those destroying businesses rather the force would have stood guard at sites of unrest while law enforcement officers entered looted businesses and arrested suspects the documents reveal that the missouri guard was especially concerned that adversaries might use phone apps and police scanners to expose operational security counterintelligence operations are directed at supporting an information campaign their audience does not require the information to be accurate and is easily swayed one document read a document titled operation showme protection ii which outlines the missouri national guards mission in ferguson listed players on the ground deemed friendly forces and enemy forces among groups characterized as hate groups were the kkk the rgb black rebels and the new black panther party but also general protesters the document read protesters have historically used molotov cocktails rocks and other debris to throw at police several small arms fire incidents have occurred some elements may utilize militants sic tactics taught by usper rgb black rebels a communication specifying the types of gear and dangers the soldiers were likely to face warned that rioters likely have constructed homemade protection like goggles gas masks and plywood shields further select individuals may have bullet proof vests and may carry firearms it further noted that a possible method of attack is the use of molotov cocktails against personnel and equipment also the possibility exists of the use of arson for destruction and disruption of the power grid through targeted attack in addition to analyzing the threat general protesters could pose to soldiers the national guard also briefed its commanders on their intelligence capabilities so they could deny adversaries the ability to identify missouri national guard vulnerabilities upon which threat forces may exploit causing embarrassment or harm to the mong the mission set states adversaries are most likely to possess human intelligence humint open source intelligence osint signals intelligence sigint technical intelligence techint and counterintelligence capabilities states appendix 3 which outlines operations security but the ways the national guard lists for how this information can be obtained are nothing more than open records social media and listening on conversations being carries out in public by civil authorities or law enforcement overseas deployments are all about predictability col david boyle of the missouri national guard warned in an email on august 25 in the wake of protests just two weeks after the death of michael brown dsca defense in support of civil authorities is not it is all about rapid expansion and contraction to fit quickly shifting support requirements correction an earlier version of this story misstated details about the st louis county grand jurys decision on whether to indict

        "article": "rolling stoneone summer a few years ago frances bean cobain worked as an intern in the new york offices of rolling stone frances  the daughter of nirvana singerguitarist kurt cobain and an executive producer of the new hbo documentary on his life kurt cobain montage of heck  was a 15yearold goth kid so stoked she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the jonas brothers  and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of kurt yeah frances says with a grin and mockexasperation looking at my dad every day preview the cover story and listen to a previously unheard cobain song here that is one of many stories and revelations that come out over almost three hours late one afternoon in early march as frances now 22 and a visual artist speaks publicly for the first time about her father life after his death her complex relationship with her mother courtney love and the new film written directed and produced by brett morgen kurt got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art because the world demanded it of him frances says bluntly at one point i think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he didnt want to be here and everyone would be happier without him rolling stone listen to a previously unheard kurt cobain song  but in reality if he had lived she goes on i would have had a dad and that would have been an incredible experience what follows are additional excerpts from a remarkable  and moving  conversation how would you describe montage of heck its emotional journalism its the closest thing to having kurt tell his own story in his own words  by his own aesthetic his own perception of the world it paints a portrait of a man attempting to cope with being a human when brett and i first met i was very specific about what i wanted to see how i wanted kurt to be represented i told him i dont want the mythology of kurt or the romanticism even though kurt died in the most horrific way possible there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him because hes 27 forever the shelf life of an artist or musician isnt particularly long kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age he will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful rolling stone 17 young innovators shaking up the music industry  there is with any great artist a little manicness and insanity tropic of cancer is one of my favorite books and author henry miller had this work ethic where he would get out of bed every day and force himself to write five pages it taught me that if you do the work you progress so many people are content to settle my dad was exceptionally ambitious but he had a lot thrown on him exceeding his ambition he wanted his band to be successful but he didnt want to be the f voice of a generation do you remember the first time you heard a nirvana record  and knowing that was your father ive talked to sean lennon about this he had a few more years with his dad that you did but for him the records were a road into understanding his father after he was gone i dont really like nirvana that much grins sorry promotional people universal im more into mercury rev oasis brian jonestown massacre laughs the grunge scene is not what im interested in but territorial pissings on nevermind is a f great song and dumb on in utero  i cry every time i hear that song its a strippeddown version of kurts perception of himself  of himself on drugs off drugs feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation rolling stone elton john michael stipe defend transgender prisoners rights  the irony is that he wrote it before nirvana made nevermind i know it was projection to something theres no way anyone can wrap their minds around that did you feel awkward as a teenager not being that interested in the music kurt made no i would have felt more awkward if id been a fan i was around 15 when i realized he was inescapable even if i was in a car and had the radio on theres my dad hes larger than life and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians we love to put them on a pedestal if kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible    but he wasnt he inspired people to put him on a pedestal to become st kurt he became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive you dont think it could have gotten any bigger but it did after the first screening i attended there was a guy who said montage of heck was a very interesting film about people he didnt like laughs thats a pretty good description rolling stone a guide to cobains cinematic legacy  i found it interesting that the way morgen told kurts story didnt evoke any sympathy for that viewer  that kurts art did not resonate with him all he saw was a personalty he didnt like that is an interesting perspective for me the film provided a lot more factual information about my father  not just tall tales that were misconstrued misremembered rehashed retold 10 different ways it was factual evidence of who my father was as a child as a teenager as a man as a husband as an artist it explored every single aspect of who he was as a human being what was it like hearing his voice ive been hearing his voice forever through his music i was thinking more of his speaking voice his speaking voice is sort of similar to mine its sort of a monotone the depth to it is similar to the way i speak i dont know what the f that is i wasnt even talking when he was around dont mistake the power of genes its very weird how genes are dave grohl krist novoselic and pat smear came over to a house where i was living it was the first time the exnirvana members had been together in a long time and they had what i call the k c jeebies which is when they see me they see kurt they look at me and you can see theyre looking at a ghost they were all getting the k c jeebies hardcore dave said she is so much like kurt they were all talking amongst themselves rehashing old stories id heard a million times i was sitting in a chair chainsmoking looking down like this affects total boredom and they went you are doing exactly what your father would have done but i was glad they came over smiles it was a cool experience like having a nirvana reunion minus one except for his spawn what do you want to do next now that this film is coming out in being one of the executive producers youre stepping into the public at almost the same age your father was when he made nirvanas first album the timing is   i like to think of it as poetic coincidental yeah oddly enough being 22 its the first year a fire has been lit under my ass  not because of the documentary just personally i have this motivation and ambition that i didnt have before i want to go paint this painting the hardest part of doing anything creatively is just getting up and doing once i get out of bed and get into my art room i start painting im there and im doing it copyright  2015 rolling stone",

        "article": "cnn hillary clinton is now officially a candidate for president  and the never ending clinton story rumbles on she has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century she started as the first lady that the right loved to hate then the deceived wife next a senator then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally a secretary of state the republicans have their aristocratic bushes the democrats have their clintons and if hillary or jeb were to win two presidential terms then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025 28 will have had a clinton or a bush in the white house the great american republic now looks about as democratic as game of thrones but even though hillary clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime the economist may speak for many when it asks what does hillary stand for there is a paradox she presents she is by far the bestknown presidential candidate across both parties and for the moment almost unchallenged within her own yet even though diane feinstein can assert confidently that hillary doesnt need the white house but she wants it  the question unanswered is what for and for liberals who believe that government is there to do something its this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about clinton there are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to clinton the economy has revived under obama but say critics largely to the benefit of wall street and the superrich the riots in ferguson missouri were a painful reminder that the poor particularly the nonwhite poor have been left behind clintons credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed it is true as the wall street times notes that she has previously called for universal prekindergarten equal pay for women increases in the minimum wage paid family leave higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded earned income tax credit for workingpoor families but she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the occupy crowd for the countrys inequality clinton is now wisely trying to distance herself from the clinton foundation  after all its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism then there is her foreign policy record clinton voted in 2002 to authorize the iraq war though in her memoir last year she backed away from the vote writing that she got it wrong as secretary of state she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in syria the crisis in libya and the collapse of the mubarak regime in egypt that some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point clinton is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the obama administration her personal ethics are on the agenda too  as demonstrated by the flap over her use of a private email account these are the issues that her democratic rivals are running on in iowa last week both jim webb and martin omalley attacked wall street webb adding that he had also opposed the iraq war both men questioned the wisdom of clintonian triangulation  the idea that the white house can be won and the country successfully governed by always seeking the middle ground both men would be wise to focus on iowa to contrast a populist folksy campaign with the distant overmanaged style of clinton and both would do well to tap into a feeling that it would be unhealthy undemocratic and plain dull to let hillary coast to the nomination without a proper challenge nevertheless there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that democrats want a race and the polling evidence that clinton would beat anyone who tried to take her on why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is hillary the explanation is that the democratic party is intellectually impoverished we hear often of the gops problems how out of touch with a changing electorate it is and how it is divided against itself the democrats challenges however are just as substantial theyve just been masked by having a charismatic man in the white house dominating the national conversation obama was elected at one of the highest points of national democratic popularity but since then democratic power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections  leaving the party without significant representation in the deep south and absent any mildly conservative support at all everything was staked on obamacare which was ambitious and noble venture but without an obvious second act to follow democrats have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms and the mood of their base can be felt either in the violence in missouri or the disaffected hollow laughter of the daily show audience cynicism abounds who really imagines that hillary clinton is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals to repeat the question what is she exactly running for if she has one trump card to play however it is reinvention recall that she started the 2008 primaries out as a moderate playitsafe frontrunner and ended them drinking beer in an indiana bar  reinvented in the words of barack obama as annie oakley if there is little intellectualism left in liberalism at least hillary clinton is clever which is why she remains an asset to her party",

bridge  the only safe route from baghdad to neighboring anbar province isis has taken the east of the city its not accessible he says sounding frantic rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas isis fighters had just stormed into moments later we see the impact an endless stream of humanity shell shocked and exhausted parents cradle babies in blankets some struggle under the weight of their belongings some carry small plastic bags while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the euphrates the government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into iraqs capital those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men normally used to carry produce to markets an elderly woman sits in one a child in her arms a worn down plastic doll in her hand many dont want to talk at least not for long what they just went through is too raw too painful one man we encounter describes how isis fighters commandeered his house we heard clashes in the early morning and we couldnt see the security forces anywhere he recalls we saw the isis fighters they just came into the house they didnt say a word they just sent a sniper to the roof  i grabbed my children and ran his wife bursts into tears prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore  they just want to keep going another older woman sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren starts sobbing the moment we approach her they took our homes and kicked us out she cries over the weekend isis moved into towns just to the north of ramadi which lies 68 miles 110km west of baghdad sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city  isis had already blocked off access from the south months ago and the west was contested territory  the east until now was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit at a hospital in amriyat alfalluja about a 15minute drive away a wounded local fighter winces in pain he was shot by a sniper in ramadi that morning as isis fighters advanced  the bullet barely missed his heart we had been warning we could see their movements he tells us but we just didnt have the force to hold them off  we didnt leave a single person we didnt call and ask for back up but none came hours after our morning conversation we speak to essawi again by phone security is collapsing in the city he screams this is what we warned baghdad would happen where is baghdad where is alabadi just god knows if we will survive this he says and hangs up amriyat alfalluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from isis positions nearby the hospitals fa\u00e7ade is scarred by shrapnel the wards are full of people injured during these attacks fifteenyearold mustafa ahmed has bandages on his neck leg and other parts of his body a mortar fell on our street one of my neighbors was wounded he explains we went out to help him and the second one fell on us his friend died he says in the next room amal ahmed speaks softly i was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open she says as tears roll down her face something fell out of me and i grabbed it and i put it back in and i lay down she starts to cry harder her husband was killed by us forces in fallujah  another city in anbar  in 2003  her children have all moved away except her youngest who broke his arm in the same attack when i see the situation i dont have hope its just getting worse a few moments later we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospitals buildings they think its an isis rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the iraqi forces we are with in the hallway away from the windows more explosions go off in the distance then another actually shakes our building anyone want tea one of the policemen with us asks laughing as he pours  this happens all the time were used to it the police chief major aref aljanabi radios to his men to respond  aljanabi like so many others is frustrated with the lack of support from baghdad  earlier he had taken us to the front lines a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions  he says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for isis positions but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements more explosions follow in the distance were quickly moved out and leave the town heading back towards the bridge and the long snaking lines of refugees an ambulance passes us trying to force its way through the crowds  the swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours  not surprising given essawis dire assessment and warning ramadi is under siege from all sides hed told us earlier anger mixed with an air of resignation i consider the city to have fallen he claimed that 150000 have fled scoffing at statements from iraqi officials in baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to ramadi  he has yet to see them",

        "article": "cnn japanese prime minister shinzo abe is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of congress the address marks the first time in history that the head of the japanese government will address the entire us congress and given the importance of the usjapan relationship it is an invitation long overdue so far prime minister abes appearance has garnered much less attention than last months speech to congress by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu this is not surprising in a recent survey by the pew research center nearly threequarters of the respondents indicated they had never heard of shinzo abe underscoring just how difficult it is for the obama administration to sell its muchvaunted pivot or rebalance to the american public nevertheless abe arrives in washington at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the pivot the transpacific partnership free trade agreement or tpp the tpp is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the united states japan and 10 other pacificfacing nations  combined these countries account for 40 of global gdp  and beyond its potential economic impact it also allows the united states to expand its influence in asia providing an alternative to chinacentered agreements such as the regional cooperative economic partnership the stakes therefore are significant but so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret prominent democrats such as ohio sen sherrod brown and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren for example have been critical of the tpp arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine us sovereignty but the immediate battle in congress is not over the tpp directly but something called trade promotion authority or fasttrack  trade promotion authority which would allow trade agreements such as the tpp to come before congress without amendment has been on the books for decades  the power to use trade promotion authority however must be periodically reauthorized  congress voted narrowly to give president bush trade promotion authority in 2002 but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed there is near universal agreement that the current talks cannot be concluded unless the congress reauthorizes trade promotion authority without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks cannot be confident that the united states speaks with one voice republicans control both houses of congress and are generally supportive of free trade but while passage of trade promotion authority in the senate is likely the result in the house where abe will be speaking is less certain  this is in part because some house republicans are simply loath to delegate any power to the president while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016  after all the fact that republicans would actually be supporting the proposal of a democratic president will not prevent democrats  and their labor supporters  from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for republicans among those white workingclass voters who were so crucial to republican success in the 2014 midterm but even if trade promotion authority passes the fight over the tpp is far from over  provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before congress can grant final approval to the tpp  this likely throws the tpp vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race ironically the fact that democrats seem likely to nominate hillary clinton an early supporter of the tpp may go a long way to blunting this attack  still it is hard to see house republicans willing to go it alone on the tpp without some democratic buyin which brings us back to prime minister abes speech given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii there will be an understandable focus on what the prime minister says regarding his nations role in that conflict in the eyes of many in china and south korea japan has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions while the united states itself expressed disappointment over a visit abe made to the controversial yasukuni shrine yet despite such criticisms a pew poll found a plurality in the united states thinks that the apologies that japan has issued in the past about the war are sufficient as a result for much of the us audience abes words about the tpp will be of equal importance to questions of history so what will the prime minister say and will his support for tpp be enough to sway congress certainly abe has a lot riding on the agreement domestically he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling liberal democratic party and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse this suggests that the big challenge for abe on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the tpp in a way that convinces the american people that the trade agreement is not about enriching us corporations and outsourcing us jobs but strengthening the usjapan alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the united states and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of china its a tall task especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech but its a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand but for the success of president obamas pivot to asia and with that in mind prime minister abe wont be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday",

        "article": "cnn in july of 2013 the oldest of jesus relics stories rose again when turkish archaeologists discovered a stone chest in a 1350yearold church that appeared to contain a piece of jesus cross we have found a holy thing in a chest it is a piece of a cross said excavation team leader g\u00fclg\u00fcn k\u00f6ro\u011flu an art historian and archaeologist at the time she thought the chest served as a symbolic coffin for a holy persons relics  ones connected to jesus crucifixion and then silence the latest relic of the cross on which jesus had died stalled out because as k\u00f6ro\u011flu later said the box that had contained allegedly holy objects was now  mysteriously  empty the latest episode of the true cross a powerful identifier for the faith of more than two billion people is symbolic of the pitfalls in the hunt for jesus relics to say something smacks of the true cross can mean its a matter of divine certainty or of utter fraud could fragments of the true cross of jesus really be among us today could fragments of a tree survive millennia or are they fragments of forgery that speak to our need to believe the true cross phenomenon begins with emperor constantine the first roman emperor to convert to christianity he sent his mother saint helena c 246330 ce to find jesus objects in the holy land when helena traveled to jerusalem in 326 ce the city was still suffering the destruction caused by the last jewish war in 13235 ce after defeating israel roman emperor hadrian built a pagan temple over jesuss tomb near calvary  a grave insult to the new religion helena ordered this pagan temple torn down and began to dig beneath it to find relics related to jesus her workers found three different crosses  a discovery directly relating to the gospels which tell us that jesus was crucified along with two criminals the historian rufinus c 340410 reveals that in order to discern which cross was jesus helena had a dying local woman brought to the site the ill woman touched two of the crosses but nothing happened then she touched the third  and she recovered the true cross of jesus had been revealed helena carved it up leaving some of it in jerusalem and transporting a chunk to europe where it seemingly multiplied so much so that protestant reformer john calvin said  if all the pieces that could be found were collected together they would make a big shipload yet the gospel testifies that a single man was able to carry it but was calvin exaggerating to support his own reforms to catholicism how could we ever know what the true cross was made of or looked like since neither the gospels  nor the romans  bothered to tell us enter science in 1870 french architect charles rohault de fleury catalogued all known fragments of the true cross he determined the jesus cross weighed 165 pounds was three or four meters high with a cross beam two meters wide if all these bits of the cross were cobbled together he reckoned they wouldnt amount to a third of the cross on which jesus died and based on the fragments he was allowed to examine by microscope de fleury concluded the true cross was made of pine wood later four cross particles were also microscopically examined  part of ten pieces of the true cross accompanied by documentary proofs from byzantine emperors these fragments came from grand european churches santa croce in rome notre dame in paris and the cathedrals of pisa and florence but scientists discovered that they were all made of olive wood so now the question became was the cross of jesus made of olive wood or pine one of the perplexing realities for archaeologists is a lack of residual wood from the massive record of roman crucifixion despite the fact the romans killed tens of thousands of people through crucifixion  and as many as 500 a day during the siege of jerusalem from 6670 ce  the only piece of evidence connected to this terrible punishment was discovered in 1968 when archaeologists found the heel bone of a crucified man with the nail still intact in the israel museum in jerusalem israel hershkovitz who teaches anatomy and archaeology at tel aviv university said that the heel bone of the crucified man was found in a jewish burial tomb in a northern suburb of jerusalem near golgotha  the hill where the romans crucified people the man whose ossuary or burial box identified him as yehohanan was in his mid 20s when he died on the cross his good teeth and lack of heavy musculature meant that he most likely came from a wealthy family for most crucifixion victims were far too humble to wind up in tombs save for jesus who was put in one by the wealthy joseph of arimathea others buried in the same tomb as yehohanan had connections to the temple so its possible that he was killed by the romans for some political transgression yehohanan was cut down from the cross with a 45inch nail still in his right heel bone and with part of a board still attached to the head of the nail hershkovitz believes that the relative shortness of the length of the nail reveals much about roman crucifixion methods the nail was too short to go through two heel bones so sure enough each foot was hammered separately to the cross hershkovitz is convinced that crosses were not made from olive trees because the people depended on the olive tree for food and wouldnt be slashing them down to make crosses more importantly for the purpose at hand they wouldnt be suitable because of the structure of the tree itself olive trees dont grow tall and straight it branches everywhere and there are a lot of holes in the wood making it difficult to support the nails against the weight of the victim the olive tree is the least appropriate tree we have different type of local oaks that better serve the purpose today there are even more true cross fragments on display around the world on mount athos in rome in brussels in venice in ghent in paris in spain in serbia  and even in boalsburg pennsylvania where a fragment of the true cross came along as part of the family chapel imported there and rebuilt by theodore boal for his french bride if you want your own sliver of the cross on which jesus died ebay offers several choices  with some having original wax seals preserving integrity and some having documents attesting to their authenticity mark goodacre a professor at duke universitys department of religion says that this continued emphasis on the genuineness of true cross fragments is often at the expense of the crosss meaning the thing about the cross is youve always got to remember that its about the person who hung there the wood itself in the end is just the instrument of torture michael mckinley is coauthor with david gibson of finding jesus faith fact forgery six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels",

        "article": "canberra australia cnn before bali nine duo  andrew chan and myuran sukumaran the last australian executed for drug offenses abroad was van tuong nguyen by singapore in 2005 although canberra then as it is now was strongly opposed to the death penalty vans death did not harm australias relationship with singapore nor the australian peoples view of that country the executions of chan and sukumaran early wednesday morning will be a different story their deaths will result in short to medium term frictions between canberra and jakarta at the highest levels however this will soon ease as the two countries have a number of common interests that neither side can abandon but the australian publics view of indonesia and anger with its government will take much longer to subside those sympathetic to the dilemma faced by indonesias president joko widodo will argue that he was politically bound to allow the executions to take place he ran on a robust antidrug campaign arguing that 18000 indonesians die from illicit drugs each year though those figures are widely disputed as the saga over whether the executions would take place dragged on for months following ever more desperate legal challenges from the defense teams widodo painted himself into a corner the widespread australian perception is that the president owed his power to pdip chairperson and former president megawati sukarnoputri believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country some suggest that megawati insisted widodo stand by his hardline antidrugs policy and stare down australian pressure  or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process as recently as last year it seemed that australian prime minister tony abbott empathized with the underlying pressures and backroom obligations on leaders while working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the bali nine duo abbott nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions even as he publicly reiterated australias opposition to capital punishment such a softlysoftly approach was also aided by an australian public that did not seem overly interested in the plight of chan and sukumaran all that changed when credible stories began to emerge about the rehabilitation of the two australian prisoners chan becoming a pastor and respected religious example for his fellow prisoners and sukumaran a passionate painter with impressive talent such was the regard held for the australian duo that even the governor of the kerobokan jail where they were kept sudjonggo urged a reconsideration of their impending executions as the duo attracted greater public sympathy  including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging jakarta to reconsider  the good great and popular in australian society also united behind the plea for mercy under increasing pressure in the polls the abbott government began to publicly pursue what it had been doing in private urging a stay of execution on legal and moral grounds  even once reminding jakarta of the over 1 billion worth of aid that indonesia has received from australia over the past decade australians have a dim view of how indonesia has responded while jakarta and many indonesian people viewed this as typical posturing and moral grandstanding from a developed western neighbor australians began to once again see indonesia in an unattractive light  when it was so recently upheld as the shining example of a rising democracy in southeast asia the hardline stance of widodo was seen as the heartless and selfinterested actions of a weak and inexperienced president attempting to establish his authority  at the expense of rehabilitated australian lives credible accusations by the defense attorney for the two australians that a lighter sentence was denied to them because of their incapacity to pay the bribe demanded of them from the sentencing judges affirmed perceptions of indonesias judicial system as corrupt if not incompetent particularly galling for the abbott government and australians was widodos refusal to even accept a phone call from abbott to discuss the issue and the wall of silence and nonengagement that confronted australian ministers attempting to plead the case with indonesian counterparts perhaps the final straw was indonesias decision to deploy hundreds of commandos and four naval ships to transport the handcuffed prisoners from bali to their island for execution  viewed in australia as a deliberate backhander by jakarta to canberra the abbott government had warned of unspecified consequences should the executions take place and on wednesday morning announced the unprecedented recall of australias ambassador to indonesia there are unlikely to be any ministerial visits between the two countries for many months if not the rest of the year while australia is not likely to withdraw aid to indonesia canberra will also ensure that it offers jakarta no special favors in the immediate future given the degree of ongoing cooperation on important issues such as terrorism money laundering and drug trafficking australia and indonesia will continue to work together behind the scenes at the operational levels australia will also need ongoing indonesia cooperation to stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals to australian shores and will not want to jeopardize what has already been achieved for these reasons the fallout between capitals will be contained but while the indonesian public appears divided as to whether their government acted wisely the australian public is united that jakarta did not this means that for them and even as a democracy the older images of indonesia as a corrupt immature and unpredictable neighbor will return the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author",

        "article": "cnn iran will sign a final nuclear agreement only if economic sanctions against the nation are removed on the first day of the deals implementation president hassan rouhani said thursday ayatollah ali khamenei the islamic republics supreme leader meanwhile told staterun media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it isnt final and hes not certain it will become binding because he has never been optimistic about negotiations with the us six world powers and iran reached a preliminary deal last week that aims to limit tehrans nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic  sanctions the united states however has stressed that if a final deal is reached with iran the removal of any sanctions will come in phases but work on the agreement isnt finished negotiators from iran and the united states china germany france britain and russia have until june 30 to come up with a final deal khamenei said he supports the negotiators but in several notsosubtle shots at the united states noted it is too soon to celebrate the proposed deal everything lies in the details khamenei said in a thursday address according to press tv the other side which is known for backpedaling on its commitments may want to corner our country when it comes to the specifics what has been hashed out so far is no guarantee that the deal will become final he said and according to the islamic republic news agency the leader said he cant support or oppose the deal especially when its possible the other disloyal party intends to limit our country some have asked why khamenei hasnt taken a position on the talks and the reason is simple he said according to irna there is no need to take a position officials say nothing has been done yet and that nothing is binding i am neither in favor nor against it any final deal must ensure the interests and dignity of the iranian nation he said adding he will support an agreement that will safeguard national interests and dignity he said hed rather see the agreement fail than make a deal that jeopardizes irans interests what has happened so far will neither guarantee the agreement itself nor its content it will not even guarantee completion of the negotiations therefore it is meaningless to congratulate me or others about it he said rouhani said his government would not surrender to bullying sanctions and threats according to press tv we will not sign any deal unless on the very first day of its implementation all economic sanctions against iran are lifted all at once rouhani said at  a ceremony to mark national nuclear technology day in tehran president barack obama faces an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical congress which has threatened to impose new sanctions on iran us energy secretary ernest moniz a nuclear physicist and negotiator with iran estimated it would take six months after a final deal is signed for the sanctions to be lifted he told cnns christiane amanpour that it was a ballpark figure contingent on a lot of work the iranians will have to do beforehand the core nuclear provisions must be satisfied  the provisions that give us our confidence moniz said he said its in the hands of the iranians to fulfill steps such as reducing stockpiles and lowering the number of operating centrifuges it will depend on their ability to execute those moves moniz said asked if the iranians were aware of that time frame during the negotiations  before rouhani called for the immediate lifting of sanctions  moniz said oh yes for sure the no 3 house republican leader said a bill to ease any sanctions does not stand much of a chance in the us house of representatives or senate the sanctions that were put in place  again very bipartisan sanctions passed by congress years ago that were effective  the only way to get rid of them completely would be for congress to vote to ease those sanctions rep steve scalise of louisiana said in a radio interview with wwl in new orleans on wednesday we havent had that vote i dont see that passing out of the house i dont even think it would pass out of the senate right now diplomats announced last week that theyd come up with the framework for an agreement after a marathon stretch of latenight negotiations in lausanne switzerland the framework includes the easing of us and un sanctions on iran if it takes certain steps to curb its nuclear program iran would reduce its stockpile of lowenriched uranium by 98 for 15 years and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges according to the plan in exchange the united states and the european union would lift sanctions that have crippled the countrys economy it is a good deal a deal that meets our core objectives obama said after it was announced april 2 this framework would cut off every pathway that iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon it would include strict verification measures to make sure iran complies he said the united states and iran have a long history of strained relations which made the negotiations more significant just two years ago the two countries had not talked with each other officially in nearly four decades cnns eliott c mclaughlin christine theodorou  and catherine e shoichet contributed to this report",

82 is a retired baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s  he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of durham in 1973 for the next round of his daughters fight he traveled to washington in late january to attend his daughters confirmation hearing before the judiciary committee i heard a lot at that hearing that ive heard since childhood  that is the presupposition of the mindset lorenzo lynch said  the dual system or the dual treatment when asked to provide specific examples lorenzo lynch deferred to the state branch of the naacp and e lavonia allison a durham activist who has known loretta lynch since the family moved to durham i dont want to think about the epidermis but some people are thinking that way allison said suggesting that lynchs confirmation vote has been delayed because lynch is africanamerican when it has taken so long when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated  how else can we interpret that it is so different allison said in march rep gk butterfield dnorth carolina chairman of the congressional black caucus said i think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay but its also the irrationality of the new republicans sen dick durbin dillinois evoked imagery of the segregated south in criticism of republicans saying lynch had been asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the senate calendar durbin was harshly criticized by arizonas sen john mccain i deeply regret that the senator from illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation mine and my republican colleagues mccain said on the senate floor  it was offensive and unnecessary and i think he owes this body ms lynch and all americans an apology mccain added i thought he should be commended lorenzo lynch said  i think thats a poetic description of what has happened and poetry like most language is limited but it does have wings  to carry a point giuliani pushes for lynch confirmation  senate republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on lynchs nomination is because she is africanamerican many point out that lynch if confirmed will be replacing the countrys first africanamerican attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin instead republicans and democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle  for some its part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the senate  for others the delay is retaliation for president obamas 2014 executive actions on immigration on the eve of holders announcement of his plans to leave the department of justice the political number crunchers at fivethirtyeightcom predicted that whoever the president nominated would likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the senate some of lynchs supporters across north carolina have organized to convince the states two republican senators to support lynchs confirmation  in march several dozen north carolina women led by the naacp traveled to washington to meet with their senators richard burr and thom tillis reportedly the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial at a news conference at the washington press club the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination senator burr and senator tillis it is time for you to act like you have some sense  its past time  you have embarrassed the state of north carolina allison said after the meeting for their part burr and tillis released a statement after the meeting while we remain concerned with ms lynchs stated desire to lead the department of justice in the same manner as eric holder and will not be supporting her nomination we are grateful that the group came to washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas weeks later the naacp organized protests outside the senators offices in raleigh charlotte and wilmington i think there is a much deeper analysis said north carolina naacp branch president rev william barber ii  i believe if she had been clarence thomas she would have been confirmed because of her courage her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement  that is what they fear barber said obama turns up the heat on loretta lynch confirmation limbo lorenzo lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders  he admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of africanamericans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights now his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughters nomination and photos of his visit to the white house lynch admits that hes never told his only daughter that hes proud of her although hes sure she knows it  he plans to change that soon regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination",

        "article": "cnn on the surface the mixup seems incomprehensible how can a volunteer sheriffs deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser killing a man thats apparently what happened in tulsa oklahoma when a 73yearold reserve deputy robert bates killed eric harris bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead oh i shot him im sorry bates said in a video of the shooting but its happened before in a wellpublicized 2009 case a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser killing 22yearold oscar grant in oakland california the former officer johannes mehserle testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct so how easy  or hard  is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser here are some factors to consider  law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officers dominant side of the body and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side so if an officer is lefthanded the gun should be on the left side bates attorney said his client is lefthanded but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side  his nondominanant side i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed bates said in a written statement to investigators after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser he used his nondominant hand and it was the gun said clark brewster bates attorney he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder assumed it was the taser brewster said both the gun and the taser have a laser sight and he just made a mistake brewster also said his clients left hand was holding a pepper gun in his statement to investigators bates said he had grabbed a pepper ball launcher to try to slow or stop harris who was running away bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was startled by the recoil of the gun after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief he told investigators bates is now charged with seconddegree manslaughter if convicted he faces up to four years in prison deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in  bates was carrying his personal gun a smith  wesson 357 fiveshot revolver and a model x26 taser he said in his statement to investigators attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices one held up a small black 357 revolver followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun theres no way an officer can get this confused with this said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen smolen  roytman tasers x26 model comes in different designs some are mostly yellow while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle but all appear to be larger than smith  wesson 357 fiveshot revolvers sgt jim clark of the tulsa police department  which is separate from the county sheriffs office for which bates volunteered  said bates was the victim of something called slip and capture thats when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a highstress situation but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to junk science theres no peerreviewed articles that would support this  its not generally accepted by the scientific community said phil stinson an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university so its something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence an attorney for the harris family said the slip and capture theory hasnt held up in court the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland of oscar grant the attorney said and that defense failed tasers are built to feel and look different than guns according to taser international steve tuttle vice president for strategic communications at taser noted some of those differences to cnn a gun is heavier a taser has a different grip and feel when you take the safety off on a taser an led control panel lights up theres more tasers can be different colors yellow or black and the holster is different from a guns but in the field where an officer reacts on instinct there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important tuttle said tasers training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officers nondominant side as law enforcement experts say and its training suggests that officers shout aloud taser taser taser as they prepare to deploy it these guidelines are designed so that in the moment  when an officers muscle memory kicks in  the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for it is up to each law enforcement department however in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular the stun guns or conducted electrical weapons manufactured by taser have been used more than 27 million times tuttle said and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death cnns catherine e shoichet brooke baldwin ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report",

        "article": "cnn if i had to describe the usiranian relationship in one word it would be overmatched were playing checkers on the middle east game board and tehrans playing threedimensional chess iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices all the while convincing ourselves that americas policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track iran isnt 10 feet tall in this region but by making the nuclear issue the beall and endall that is supposed to reduce irans power the united states is only making tehran taller consider the following  the usiranian relationship is not symmetrical its not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors iran is about to try a us citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from irans serial abuse of human rights including  the behavior of its shia militias in iraq i can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behindthescenes plan to have iran release jason rezaian if not were legitimizing a bad regime and compromising us values and interests  in the process by not ensuring that all americans being held by iran come out as part of the nuclear deal america is alienating some of our closest allies because of the iran deal and iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see irans power rising our friends arent perfect particularly the saudis and even the israelis but we need them precisely because iran is rising sadly the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities in the meantime irans allies bashar alassads syria hezbollah and now the houthis  not proxies but instruments of convenience  see whats happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the iranian game the russians too realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency were  losing friends iran is gaining them and in one of the cruelest ironies irans way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah the nuclear issue as the arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power egypt iraq syria iran is rising the argument here is not that iran is taking over the middle east but in its zone of influence a zone critical to the united states  syria iraq the gulf yemen lebanon  it is expanding its influence not contracting washington doesnt play this kind of game well it is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat isis in syria and yet not empower alassad no answer how to combat isis in iraq without favoring the shiadominated government and alienating iraqi sunnis no answerand how to backstop the saudis in yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes no answer iran has a much easier time managing contradictions indeed it can use the threat of isis to keep the americans away from weakening their ally alassad as well as expand its influence in iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest battle group naval assets to the gulf of aden notwithstanding the united states is being outfoxed not outgunned dont expect us ships to stop those of iran as state department spokesperson marie harf said there are reports about these us ships that have been moved and i want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression they are not there to intercept iranian ships the purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe i think there was some misreporting and confusion on this i just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those iranian ships it clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain irans nuclear program but we should have no illusions about two things first we wont end teherans nuclear weapons pretensions and two we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy not constraining it  one of the reasons the united states wont strike alassad is for fear of emboldening isis but the other is that we dont want a proxy war with iran in syria as the russians have made clear in their recent s300 deal the nuclear negotiations are only making iran a more acceptable business partner and the real fruits of the diplomacy havent even begun yet sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up not tamp down their regional aspirations weve made our bed apparently and now are going to have to find a way to sleep a nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now but unless it really does change irans behavior weve only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road",

        "article": "cnn the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs and the charges are serious indeed a 15count indictment filed in federal court in california bristles with accusations of conspiracies transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions violations of the controlled substances act misbranding charges and money laundering charges who is this menace to society fedex yes the courier delivery service wait can companies even be charged with crimes  where would a fedex be incarcerated  is there a corporate shawshank prison  how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person its a practice the supreme court has approved of for over a century in fact in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people  corporations dont have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive but corporate convictions on the other hand turn tidy profits for the us government with zero prison overhead even if corporations can be held criminally liable should a courier service like fedex be held liable for possessing what bad guys may send through the service the answer according to fedex is not just no but a no so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom the company maintains that it is innocent it has a point possession is an elusive concept  when it comes to drugs the law recognizes two kinds of possession actual and constructive actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband when you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket you actually possess those things the somewhat hazier concept of constructive possession means you can possess something without even having it on your person as long as you have ownership dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found for example the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5000 oxycontin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway you constructively possessed them conversely sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle but not possess it either actually or constructively in the eyes of the law such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home walk up to your door and hand you a package completely ignorant about what is inside it its hard to argue the ups guy intentionally possessed your subscription to porno mags in their nondescript brown packaging that is the idea behind the common carrier exception to possession and a large part of fedexs compelling legal argument a common carrier is one who offers its services to members of the public  without much discretion  and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation the public policy reasons behind common carrier exemptions make sense the industry simply couldnt function if every driver courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of oxycontin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door that would lead to an absurd result thats why the controlled substances act and the food drug and cosmetic act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances so long as it is in the usual course of their business of course this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves common carriers thats why the usual course of business language acts as an additional safety measure in court papers fedexs lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from jamaica to miami this would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public generally on the other hand fedex argues that it is indeed a common carrier performing the normal duties of a common carrier because a it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and b it offers its services to the public generally its hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband does this mean a greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger the bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs but if the guy boards the bus with a grateful dead tshirt and a set of bongos shouldnt the driver at least have a hunch that seems dangerously close to profiling is this another illogical straw man argument maybe obviously the department of justice disagrees which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution according to the indictment from at least as early as 2004 the drug enforcement administration the food and drug administration and members of congress put fedex on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the controlled substances act the food drug and cosmetic act and numerous state laws the indictment alleges that as early as 2004 fedex knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts fedexs couriers in kentucky tennessee and virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to fedex senior management the doj is making the argument that even though fedex carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public fedex knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity it raises a larger question though why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we cant even incarcerate the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs and drug smugglers smuggle them money power the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations  in this case it would be to force fedex to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation the government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in deferred prosecution agreements the reason you dont see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements for a company a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence whether or not its found guilty still every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence  by agreeing to pay some fines dont get me wrong im all about prosecuting the black market especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with v1agra in the subject line for our coworkers to see while we go to the bathroom i want those guys locked up for sure im just not sure that fedex has anything to do with the kingpins of the fr33 cyalis email campaign the dojs underlying intentions are noble enough  this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain it makes good strategic sense it might seem like good financial sense in the short run with the millions in fines extracted from corporations but that money has to come from somewhere its just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights it probably doesnt make good legal sense either yes we have been treating corporations as fictional persons for centuries in some ways  but its silly to treat them as persons in all ways fedex has a strong argument for dismissal in this case but even if not it wont be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon",

waste the semipro football player for the boston bandits was 27 days after he was found dead thennfl star aaron hernandez was arrested and charged with murder testimony in the case against hernandez began in january on wednesday a fall river massachusetts jury  after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days  found the former new england patriots tight end guilty of firstdegree murder which carries a penalty of life without parole  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide he has pleaded not guilty just two years ago he was one of the nfls most promising tight ends inking a 40million contract extension with the new england patriots friends and fans alike wondered how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder long before hernandez made national headlines he was a standout athlete in bristol connecticut who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty i dont think there was another family that was more familiar in bristol bob montgomery who covers high school sports for the bristol press told cnn the young hernandez was the golden boy playing football basketball and running track following in the footsteps of his uncle older brother and father  all wellknown athletes in the community hernandezs father constantly pushed his son requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends i saw a closeness with them that id never seen before montgomery said of the relationship between hernandez and his father but his father the man who kept the 16yearold anchored died from complications after a routine surgery hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the university of florida gators and trouble seemed to follow in just his first semester a police report says hernandez got into a fight at an offcampus restaurant suckerpunching the manager and rupturing his eardrum the following fall there was a shooting near a local club police reports linked hernandez and several other university of florida football players to an argument in the parking lot hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel at the time hernandezs mother told the orlando sentinel newspaper i know he was at the club but he never saw any shooting the case remains open and no one has been charged hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year trying to put the alleged drug use behind him hernandez wrote a letter to the patriots director of personnel if you draft me as a member of the new england patriots i will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season  in addition i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a prorata amount for any failed drug test he wrote according to the boston globe before the draft hernandez was expected to be a first or secondround pick he was passed over until the fourth round when the patriots selected him by the end of his second season he was a bona fide star landing the 40 million contract extension less than a year after signing the deal however the patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with lloyds murder when odin lloyd pulled up in a black chevrolet suburban boston bandits coach mike branch thought something was out of place lloyd didnt own a car aaron hernandez case whos who branch had his suspicions but he couldnt get answers lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night he said he was at the club with mr hernandez and that they were partying and he had a good time and that mr hernandez spent a good amount of money branch recalled lloyd said hernandez spent about 10000 that night lloyds friends say he wasnt a big partier he was more passionate about football and family remembering odin lloyd  lloyd was dating shaneah jenkins the link between the young man who dreamed of the nfl and the allamerican who made it jenkins is the younger sister of shayanna whos engaged to hernandez and is the mother of his little girl on june 16 2013 lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban which police later learned was rented by hernandez daryl hodge was with lloyd when he said lloyd got a text from hernandez asking to hang out later that night as they parted ways lloyd told hodge hed see him later the next day lloyds body was found prosecutors say lloyd was last seen with hernandez and hernandezs two associates carlos ortiz and ernest wallace around 230 am in a rented silver nissan altima surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an altima heading toward a secluded area at 322 am at the same time chilling text messages from lloyds phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with nfl adding just so u know between 323 and 327 am workers nearby reported hearing gunshots at 329 a camera showed an altima pulling into hernandezs driveway about a half a mile from the death scene three people got out of the car and lloyd was not one of them nine days later hernandez was arrested and charged with firstdegree murder and other weaponsrelated charges he pleaded not guilty in april 2014 ortiz and wallace were also charged in lloyds slaying they too pleaded not guilty prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture a legal term that means its not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in lloyds murder as the trial for the death of lloyd neared lawyers began arguing about evidence including cell phones and text messages some rulings were victories for the defense the jury wouldnt see the text lloyd sent to his sister telling her he was with nfl the judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadnt proven lloyd believed his life was in danger jurors also didnt hear anything about what happened in boston on july 16 2012  the night two men were murdered outside a club where hernandez had been the judge agreed with defense lawyers that its far too prejudicial and irrelevant to lloyds murder investigators allege hernandez shot and killed daniel abreu and safiro furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink district attorney patrick haggan described the scene in a massachusetts courtroom in may saying hernandez became angered and increasingly agitated particularly after mr abreu smiled and did not apologize prosecutors bump spilled drink led to double homicide  hernandezs friend tried to calm him down and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street the prosecutor said court documents identify that friend as alexander bradley who would go on to accuse hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later after leaving the second nightclub hernandez and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block haggan said hernandez began trailing abreu furtado and three of their friends in his suv authorities said he then pulled up to the victims car at a red light and leaned out the drivers side window with a loaded revolver haggan told the court hernandez allegedly said yo whats up now followed by a racial slur and fired at least five rounds from a 38caliber revolver haggan said abreu the driver was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds including one to the head haggan said hernandez was charged in the double homicide in may and he pleaded not guilty investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of lloyd cnns laura dolan kristi ramsay and michelle rozsa contributed to this report",

poverty is under 18 according to the department of regulatory and economic resources many schools face high dropout rates afterschool programs are being eliminated and students are failing those atrisk children are ones that chad bernstein is trying to help through his nonprofit guitars over guns music is the most important tool we have in reaching these kids said bernstein 30 a professional musician his program operates in two of miamis poorest communities north miami and allapattah it pairs middleschool students with professional musicians providing free instrument instruction and mentorship since 2008 bernsteins organization has worked with more than 225 students in miamidade county he says his group has seen more than a 90 increase in academic performance and school attendance of students in the program do you know a hero nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015  bernstein has been hooked on playing gigs since he was 16 hes gone on to play and record with such musical greats as shakira pharrell jennifer hudson and pitbull see more cnn heroes  i sat down with bernstein to learn more about the motivation behind his work below is an edited version of our conversation marissa calhoun youre a pretty cool guy  some might be surprised to hear that you were once bullied what did you experience and how did you overcome it chad bernstein when i was a kid i had ears that stuck out the side of my head and really big green glasses and i was tall and lanky and definitely looked a little different than other kids i think part of the thing that really stuck with me was this feeling of wanting to belong to something because i just didnt feel like i fit in with the other kids when i started playing music it really gave me a sense of identity something that i belonged to something that i was good at something that people would watch me do and say oh wow thats really cool or hes really good at that i think in that way music really gave me an anchor in my social experience calhoun what can students expect when they join your program bernstein as a new gogo student youll get to try out all the instruments youll choose an instrument to learn youll be paired with a mentor and then youll go throughout that year learning how to play the instrument and music fundamentals and songwriting and by the end of the year youll be performing on stage recording in a studio and will have a very close relationship with that mentor our mentors are amazing musicians that are active in the community playing and performing and some of these mentors are actually from the neighborhoods and the schools that these kids are at currently were not policemen were not teachers were not parents were in a unique position to really talk to these kids about the issues that matter most to them calhoun why do you focus on middle schoolers bernstein its the time of their life to reach them not only musically but also as young individuals that are starting to form opinions about who they are and what their world is going to look like as professional musicians most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life and the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school a lot of times these kids only see to the end of their block and back we like to bring them to studios and also to other places in miami because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood we also provide them with opportunities to get tutoring and have social services making sure that theyre really successful in and outside of school calhoun ive heard you play  youre pretty mean on the trombone how has that passion translated into your work with these kids bernstein ive built my life on how important the feeling i get from playing music is and i thought that that was the endall beall feeling that being on stage and performing was the thing for me then i saw a kid have that experience through our program and it changed everything theres an amazing sense of pride when i see a kid experience that feeling on stage where theyve connected with an audience or they get a round of applause because theyve worked really hard and have a great performance its an incredible feeling i was really fortunate to have the opportunities that i did to learn music and part of me feels very responsible to provide those opportunities for other people because there were people along the way in my path and my musical journey that helped me my hopes for the children that we work with are that their vision of the world and their vision of themselves is changed in some way that they hold themselves to more than other people might and that they realize theres a whole world out there that they could very much be a part of that isnt necessarily the one right outside their doorstep i know music has changed my life in a really dramatic way and i think its going to change the lives of these students in a really dramatic way want to get involved check out the guitars over guns website at wwwguitarsovergunsorg and see how to help",

the big apple can a doctor not afford an apartment the show was a breakthrough for onscreen representation  the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color  and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 201516 season recently however kalings brother vijay chokalingam unveiled a project of his own and while it has been getting a lot of attention it hasnt generated quite as many laughs  either from observers or from his famous sibling who told him it brought shame upon their family you see chokalingam revealed that as an undergraduate at the university of chicago he engaged in a daring his view or ridiculous and offensive pretty much everyone else scam he applied to medical school claiming to be africanamerican chokalingam had spent his college years as a hardpartying frat boy and achieved a less than stunning 31 gpa upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options he realized that fellow indianamericans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice  but that black hispanic and native american applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance this revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man both to dramatically improve his chances of admission and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools to accomplish this goal chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks trimmed his long indianamerican eyelashes checked black under the optional raceethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname jojo he received invitations for inperson interviews at 11 schools results that he claims support the notion that africanamericans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or asians and now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired hes looking to write a book on his experiences titled almost black the true story of an indian american who got into medical school pretending to be an african american whats truly curious is that even if you agree with chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of systematic racism when all is said and done it offers very little evidence of the privilege that he claims is accorded to black hispanic and native american candidates chokalingam had mediocre grades and mcats but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation yet even while representing himself as black chokalingam received only a single admission offer to st louis universitys school of medicine which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings harvard university of pennsylvania columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him meanwhile he admits pretending to be black came with disadvantages he found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops  who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost implying that he must have stolen it these acts of very real prejudice experienced regularly by blacks and hispanics of all backgrounds  multimillionaire comedian chris rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason  didnt seem to dissuade chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decisionmaking its not just a matter of what individual applicants deserve onethird of americans are black hispanic or native american just one in 10 physicians are since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities this lack of diversity has produced doctor deserts in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians years ago when i told my father  a doctor from a long line of doctors  that i didnt want to follow in his footsteps he told me that was fine because medicine is a service trade and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession a medical degree isnt a reward to be earned he said but a responsibility to be accepted which really cuts to the heart of whats so sad about chokalingams racial farce like others whove recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities  including putative presidential candidate jeb bush who registered himself as hispanic on a 2009 voter form and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed native american ancestry in the past  chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black peoples burden race isnt just about color or blood it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and presentday condition of a community of people many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive others are deeply painful affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nations history an imperfect one but necessary there are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own industries like health care and hollywood because whats most ironic about chokalingams decision to ride on his sisters coattails in telling his story while asians are well represented in medicine our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like mindy kaling it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces voices and stories kalings immense talent and charisma made her a star but it was a quotabased affirmative action initiative  nbcs diversity writers program  that gave her a start",

shipped to massachusetts flagship maximumsecurity prison one of the most hightech jails in the united states with no history of breakouts the souzabaranowski correctional center in shirley about 40 miles outside downtown boston its called souza for short and its the states newest prison opened in 1998 with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire i dont know the date but hell be going there thats the maximumsecurity facility department of corrections spokesman darren duarte said legal advocates for inmates describe souza as sterile and violent at once its diverse demographic includes the young and the old many of whom are also doing life one stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates the legal advocates said its very shiny and clean looking and very sterile said leslie walker executive director of prisoners legal services of massachusetts who has been visiting the souza prison about every six weeks for the past 15 years and serves indigent prisoners there but she added it is a very dangerous prison that is right now experiencing a veritable flood of opiates officials said hernandez 25 is being processed at the maximumsecurity massachusetts correctional institutioncedar junction in walpole just a handful of miles from gillette stadium where he once played tight end for the new england patriots under a fiveyear 40 million contract the prison system has yet to determine where to initially place hernandez in souza solitary confinement the less harsh but restricted block the general population a privileged section known as the lifers block for those serving a life sentence or the kitchen block for those who work in the prison kitchen at this point in time we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of hernandez is complete duarte said right now hell be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door but they will figure all that out hernandez was sent immediately for processing after wednesdays sentencing and jury conviction duarte said a news outlet helicopter followed hernandezs transfer to mci cedar junction prison officials will be concerned about hernandezs safety and whether any enemies gangs or headlineseeking inmates will try to hurt hernandez who will become souzas most famous resident there could be prisoners with a beef who are out to get him walker said then hes going to have to be separated and its going to be challenging for prison officers and perhaps for him the good news is that the superintendent of souzabaranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being who im sure will do everything he can to keep mr hernandez safe walker added the person at the top sets the tone hes fairly new and hes doing everything he can to make sure the prison is as safe as possible that superintendent osvaldo vidal couldnt be immediately reached for comment wednesday because of his celebrity hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards said larry levine a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high and minimumsecurity prisons there will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star said levine who founded wall street prison consultants which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison in the long run however it may not matter much in what section of the prison hernandez does his time about 90 of the inmates in the maximumsecurity prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day said walker the legal advocate its pretty grim walker said souza has slightly larger cells than most other massachusetts prisons but not by much walker said even so the cells are stark small rooms of painted cinderblock walls with metal fixtures a bunk mounted to the wall a toilet and sink combination a small writing shelf attached to the wall and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor walker said theres also a shelf for a small television which must have a clear back for easy inspection walker said with the exception of the tv which inmates can buy for under 200 all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them she said there are two windows one roughly 4 by 20 inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall building or trees and a tiny window on the cell door which has two slots for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door she said theres very little to do walker said of inmate life it was built as a punishment facility the thing in corrections is that you dont want people to like it there some people have been there since it opened and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both to combat opiate use among inmates prison guards use narcoticssniffing dogs for inspections walker said its pretty pathetic i have clients in souza prison who are heroin addicts who are trying to get clean walker said there also are gangs in the prison she said as for violence one elderly inmate was beaten to death last year walker said if hernandez finds himself in solitary confinement it wont be pleasant walker said solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in the lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad walker said initially prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety but i hope not walker said its very hard time opinion the shame of aaron hernandez ",

        "article": "cnn tuesday april 14 is equal pay day heres the announcement presidential candidate hillary clinton should make  today in america women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn  and the gap is even greater for women of color thats unconscionable  as president my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100 of the population is paid 100 of what theyre worth  and so im announcing that if elected president i will take a 23 pay cut equivalent to the current gender wage gap to stand in solidarity with working women in america and i wont take a raise until every woman in america gets a raise too april 14 wasnt just chosen at random as equal pay day its based on a calculation for women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014 theyd have to work until april 14 2015 a woman on average loses 431000 in pay over the course of a 40year career merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty  and at a time where republicans are still bizarrely trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth the new women warriors reviving the fight for equal rights  so heres the perfect opportunity for hillary clinton to put her money where her mouth is literally in her campaign launch and personal rebrand clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people a populist fighter for the middle class everyday americans need a champion clinton said in her campaign launch video and i want to be that champion clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through america indeed the fact that many democratic voters still clamor for a less prowar less prowall street more elizabeth warrenlike alternative to clinton is an everpresent thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of clintons inevitability opinion the myth of equal pay day  with her video clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism but can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of walmart has already lived in the white house collects sixfigure speaking fees and doesnt seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter this is where a good olfashioned political stunt would come in handy  and make no mistake about it im recommending a political stunt lets call a spade a spade hillary clinton is a very rich person while shes certainly not the first rich person to run for president her wealth  and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary americans  is an obstacle in her candidacy the difference between the current standard presidential salary of 400000 a year and the 77 centsonthedollar version of that salary or 308000 is probably a drop in the bucket in clintons bank account at this point and yet the symbolic power is profound because what clinton would be reminding us is that across america the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23 less than the aggregate salaries of all men 78 cents on the dollar the facts about the gender wage gap  thanks to the hacked sony emails we saw that even top female stars and executives in hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts what more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary clinton wouldnt just be saying she stands with the working women of america shed be showing it is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23 less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work  yes and thats the point  to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what clinton as president would do to fix it yes such stunts are trite and theatrical  theyre also effective especially in our increasingly shortattentionspan itonlyhappenedifyoucantweet it symbolismoversubstance culture politics used to be about clunky people mostly men debating complex policies now its about polished memes and even more polished candidates policy i hope still matters but were as likely to debate a candidates image as her or his substance the truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics as they are in our culture in general that doesnt mean they cant also serve a noble purpose in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions map where the gender pay gap is the widest  clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the american people in fact clinton didnt even appear in the video until the very end  it was all about middleclass americans working hard trying to get by and get ahead and then we see hillary who wants to help hillary clinton cant change who she is the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left rightly or wrongly but she can change what she does going forward how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment  but for ordinary americans who need change if clinton wins her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic and it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in america",

gave to investigators according to a statement released sunday by prosecutors in catania italy the bangladeshi migrants description provides new details about what may have happened aboard the ship which sent out a distress call in the dark of night saturday after a couple of days at sea as rescuers approached authorities say migrants on the boat moved to one side hoping to be saved their movement caused the large multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers almost 70 miles north of libya sending the desperate crowd plunging into the sea their chance of survival slim the migrant who spoke to investigators after being airlifted to a hospital in catania is among dozens who authorities say were saved from the sinking vessel he told investigators there were 950 people on board  a number prosecutors havent verified maltese authorities who are working with italian rescuers earlier said around 50 of 700 people on the boat had been saved many on lower levels of the boat were trapped inside because smugglers had locked the doors the migrant said according to prosecutors the italian coast guard is collecting statements from other survivors prosecutors said it was the latest in a series of dangerous voyages for hundreds of men women and children who boarded the boat in libya hoping to make it safely to europe passengers on the boat were from a number of nations including algeria egypt somalia niger senegal mali zambia bangladesh and ghana prosecutors said while the shipwreck was an accident maltas prime minister slammed the human traffickers who he accused of risking peoples lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat sometimes even at gunpoint prime minister joseph muscat said theyre putting them on the road to death really and nothing else its genocide  nothing less than genocide really muscat told cnn united nations high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres said that the incident could be worse than an incident last week in which 400 refugees and migrants died in the mediterranean our troops together with the italian navy are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone whos still alive muscat said of the latest incident at sea flavio di giacomo spokesman for the international organization for migration told cnn that survivors were taken to sicily the italian coast guard which is leading the rescue operation reported that at least 24 bodies had been recovered so far at the shipwreck site security for libyas borders is essential to take out these criminal gangs  these terrorists muscat said  the international community  cannot continue to turn a blind eye he added the leader of the international nonpartisan medical organization doctors without borders had strong words sunday for the tragedy a mass grave is being created in the mediterranean sea and european policies are responsible said the groups president loris de filippi he compared the high number of deaths to figures from a war zone de filippi called on european states to immediately launch largescale searchandrescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to libyan shores faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises europe has closed borders forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea he said this tragedy is only just beginning but it can and should be stopped doctors without borders will begin its own rescue effort he added because as a medical humanitarian organization we simply cannot wait any longer french president francois hollande called for the european union to help more in the rescue if the deaths are in the hundreds he said the accident could be the worst disaster in recent years in the mediterranean italian prime minister matteo renzi called an emergency cabinet meeting in rome speaking to journalists later he defended italys response adding 10 more vessels to patrol the mediterranean renzi said wouldnt solve the root of why the tragedy occurred this has to be clear there was not an absence of rescue vessels which led to the disaster and this is the proof that if you want to eradicate the problem from the root you have to respond in a different way and what were doing in the next few hours will show this renzi said the focus needs to be on eradicating human trafficking and that the responsibility lies with the whole world not just italy and malta human rights watch urged the eu to act quickly the eu is standing by with arms crossed while hundreds die off its shores said judith sunderland deputy europe and central asia director at human rights watch these deaths might well have been prevented if the eu had launched a genuine searchandrescue effort the eu released a statement sunday saying that it planned action down the road but didnt detail any immediate plans to help with the search for the victims of this accident the european commission is deeply chagrined by the tragic developments in the mediterranean today but also over the past days and weeks the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold these are human lives at stake and the european union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act it said the eu is consulting member states european agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a european migration strategy which would be adopted in middle may it stressed the need to address the situation at its roots and as long as countries of origin and transit do not take action to prevent these desperate trips people will continue to put their lives at risk the statement read many of the migrants who board ships to cross the mediterranean are from subsaharan africa and travel for weeks just to get to the ships theyre seeking a better life but many are exploited by the traffickers who organize the voyages already this year more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the mediterranean  far more than during the same period in 2014 the international organization for migration said friday in one fourday period alone more than 8000 migrants were rescued according to the italian coast guard on one day alone sos calls came in from 20 boats in distress roberta metsola a maltese member of the european parliament told cnn on sunday that countries from

came to its aid a un official said carlotta asami a spokeswoman for the united nations refugee agency made the comments to cnn early tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in catania italy they say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that you know a big ship creating a big wave  they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance asami said the account she offered differs from that provided by italian authorities on sunday they said that as the cargo ship king jacob approached late saturday migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side hoping to be saved and caused the vessel to capsize mark clark  a communications executive representing osm maritime group the company that manages the king jacob  denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize he said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side causing many to fall off the cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached hardly making any waves clark told cnn it deployed rescue boats a gangway nets and life rings he said the conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the mediterranean asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were consistent in what they were saying she said their accounts made it credible to think that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers 70 miles north of libya previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950 italian authorities who have been coordinating the rescue effort say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered the king jacob whose crew members are all from the philippines saved 22 of the survivors according to clark the cause of the shipwreck is part of italian authorities investigation said giovanni salvi catanias public prosecutor investigators want to study the king jacobs voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat he told a news conference monday the likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the mediterranean from north africa many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat while many people were down in the lowest area italian authorities said sunday that an unidentified bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in sicily on monday according to italian police officer maria guia federico they were the boats tunisian captain and a syrian crew member said salvi the catania prosecutor italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to catania salvi said according to italian media the sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the mediterranean to which european governments are struggling to respond vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the mediterranean to southern europe for years but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue the number of deaths has also skyrocketed the international organization for migration said monday that more than 1100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between libya and italy just in the past week it reported monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters shipping companies recently warned that european governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble we believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more largescale rescues with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time the european community shipowners associations said in a letter to eu leaders last month commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such largescale rescues which also create serious risks to the safety health and welfare of ships crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations the letter said commercial ships rescued more than 40000 people in the mediterranean last year according to the international organization for migration thats higher than the more than 35000 people saved by the italian coast guard but lower than the 80000 rescued by the italian navy which was running a special program mare nostrum for most of the year european union ministers met monday in luxembourg and proposed a 10point plan to help address the crisis we are not yet working on numbers but what we have agreed on today is for sure the need to increase significantly the resources at sea and the level of the operation doing more search and rescue and doing it more together said federica mogherini the eu high representative for foreign affairs and security police mogherini told cnn that the european union must fight human traffickers strengthen europeans duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees we need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions mogherini said my pain is that it was

        "article": "cnn mountaineers have returned to mount everest for this years climbing season resuming the quest to summit the worlds highest peak after a deadly season last year in 2014 the nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers the april 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on mount everest the deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the sherpas and the dangers of climbing everest in order to reduce risks the route through khumbu icefall the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer theyre going in the icefall and as we found out on april 18 its the most dangerous place said conrad anker a veteran climber who has been to everest three times theyre exposed to the tumbling ice hanging seracs above it its very very dangerous its the most dangerous place ive been in the mountains at this point in the season climbing teams have not yet entered khumbu icefall which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb mount everest with 125 of them from the previously shortened season according to the nepal ministry of tourism  its a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year the local nepalese committee that determines the path up everest announced in february that a different route had been selected the climbers will now take a central route through the khumbu icefall avoiding the area where the deaths occurred the committee comprised of sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons there will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left said yangji doma sherpa the spokeswoman for the sagarmatha pollution control committee the central route had been used in the 1990s but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route she said the new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses and use more vertical and horizontal ladders the committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders i think it will be an hour longer on the icefall said alan arnette who is blogging from everest base camp this season i dont think it will be game changer but one company alpenglow expeditions said it would stop climbing from the nepal side where the climbers have to go through the icefall in favor of the northern route from china weve seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years said  adrian ballinger the companys founder and ceo we believe the risk is too great for our workers according to the china tibet mountaineering association 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to everest this year thats 136 more than last year the chinese side of everest has typically been less popular than its nepal counterpart because of concerns of government closures some everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain but it also doesnt have an icefall the increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst nepali companies that climbers will divert to the chinese side i can already see the shift with mountaineers i speak to said dawa steven sherpa who is based in nepal more people are going to go to tibet than nepal nepal needs the tourism far more than china does china has incredible wealth of resources and nepal does not leading expeditions is how sherpas feed their families and send their children to school nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year and while they may be ready to return to the summit their families are not many of them are leaving behind nervous stressedout wives and children whose memories of what happened last year are fresh said dawa sherpa managing director of asian trekking they do say they dont want to put them through that again he said theyre not fearful for their own lives its what theyre putting their family through several mountaineers are also returning this year one of them is jon reiter who spoke to cnn last year after the tragedy when the icy avalanche thundered down reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his sherpa guide reiter who is making his way to base camp this year could not be reached directly but he explained why hes heading back to everest this year on his blog i cant quite find the words to tell you why or what really pulls me back to the mountains he wrote when we were in the midst of last years events it was hard to see the big picture it was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that its more rare than not it was hard for me to remember that im not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains i like to think its similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway cnns sugam pokharel contributed to this report",

        "article": "washington cnn supreme court justices appeared divided tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage with justice anthony kennedy returning to a familiar role as the courts pivotal vote chief justice john roberts  who shocked conservatives with his swing vote to uphold obamacare  this time seemed to lean more closely to conservative justices the arguments unfurled inside a packed courtroom on tuesday while supporters and opponents of samesex marriage rallied outside  with one protester even interrupting the arguments from within related how a cincinnati judge could shape the gay marriage case  many questions on tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system all eyes were on justice anthony kennedy considered a key vote for challengers to the state bans who has penned three decisions in favor of gay rights over the years at the start of arguments he joined other conservatives concerned with the fact that  marriage has been defined between a man and a woman for a long time this definition has been with us for millennia he said and its very difficult for the court to say oh well we know better  but later kennedy pressed john bursch a lawyer defending the bans same sex couples say of course we understand the nobility and the sacredness of the marriage we know we cant procreate but we want the other attributes of it in order to show that we too have a dignity that can be fulfilled  kennedy also said that burschs assertion that only oppositesex couples can have a bonding with the child was just a wrong premise when bursch said the rate of outofwedlock birth has gone up in the country kennedy noted that if bursch were to prevail it might be difficult for samesex couples to adopt some of these children i think kennedy said the argument cuts quite against you he also brought up the fact that marriage bestows dignity these parties say they want to have that same ennoblement he said chief justice john roberts was also concerned with the traditional definition of marriage he said this to mary l bonauto an attorney representing the challengers youre not seeking to join the institution youre seeking to change what the institution is he expressed concern about closing off the debate currently going on in the states i mean closing of debate can close minds and it will have a consequence on how this new institution is accepted people feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it than if its imposed on them by the courts he said conservative justice antonin scalia and justice samuel alito were sharply critical in their questioning of bonauto scalia said that the issue is not whether there should be samesex marriage but who should decide the point alito brought up how long marriage has been considered between a man and a woman and cast doubt that such a definition was meant to demean samesex couples justice sonia sotomayor and other liberals seemed supportive of the challengers when bursch said that the issue should not be decided by the courts  sotomayor pushed back i suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that theres some gay people who will choose not to  just as there are some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry so were not taking anybodys liberty away steve vladeck a constitutional law professor at american university and cnn analyst said tuesdays session revealed few surprises to close observers of the court who expected kennedy and roberts would be the swing votes on this case related john roberts big moment will he anger conservatives again we heard both of them in the arguments today showing support for both sides of the argument showing skepticism for both sides of the argument vladeck said i think the headline here is its about what we expected its going to be close its going to be divisive and its going to come down to kennedy and roberts vladeck also cautioned against reading too much into the justices questioning and comments during the oral arguments which account for just a few hours in the multimonth process of deciding such an consequential case the emotion of the case also flooded into the courtroom as one protester seated inside began shouted and screaming in the middle of the arguments if you support gay marriage you will burn in hell the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream related meet the lawyers who will argue the gay marriage case  rather refreshing actually conservative justice antonin scalia quipped as the man was dragged out to laughter in the courtroom lawyers with the progay marriage organization lambda legal which represented two of the cases wrapped into the supreme court case an aweinspiring and singular moment in the march towards justice it was incredibly moving to gather in the supreme court chamber with their parents and all 30 plaintiffs in these historic cases   mary and doug were fantastic making a compelling and to my mind irrefutable case on their behalf lambda legals alphonse gerhardstein said of the lawyers who argued in favor of samesex marriage before the court on tuesday us solicitor general donald verrilli who represented the obama administrations views also presented arguments in favor of samesex marriage focusing on equal protection under the 14th amendment and likening bans on samesex marriage to handing secondclass status to gay americans i dont know why we would repeat history he said",

as morning prayers were underway shooting indiscriminately and taking hostages before being killed by security forces officials said the us embassy in nairobi said alshabaab militants have claimed responsibility the harrowing attack comes just months after alshabaab militants murdered nonmuslim workers in a kenyan quarry the terrorist group has been behind numerous attacks in the region it has also recruited some americans particularly from the somaliamerican community in minnesota alshabaab is a somali group that the united states designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march 2008 it wants to turn somalia into a fundamentalist islamic state according to the council on foreign relations the group has been blamed for attacks in somalia that have killed international aid workers journalists civilian leaders and african union peacekeepers it has a history of striking abroad too before admitting to the kenya quarry attack alshabaab claimed responsibility for the july 2010 suicide bombings in kampala uganda that killed more than 70 people including a us citizen who had gathered at different locations to watch the broadcast of the world cup final soccer match the total size of alshabaab is not clear in 2011 a us official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said the group was estimated to control up to 1000 fighters a united nations report identified one insurgent leader who is believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters most of them kenyans and alshabaab has links to other organizations in february 2012 the groups leader ahmed abdi godane and al qaeda leader ayman alzawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made somalia a target for radical islamist groups alshabaabs predecessor was alittihad alislami aiai which worked to create an islamist emirate in somalia it was partially funded by former al qaeda leader osama bin laden according to the council on foreign relations aiai which the us state department designated as a terrorist group strengthened after the fall in 1991 of siad barres military regime and during the years of lawlessness that ensued in 2003 a rift erupted between aiais old guard  which was seeking to establish a new political front  and its younger members who wanted to impose fundamental islamic rule alshabaab means the youth that strife led the younger members to ally with a group of sharia courts  the islamic courts union icu  that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city working together the islamic courts union and alshabaab gained control of mogadishu in 2006 that sparked fears in neighboring ethiopia that violence would spill over there according to the council on foreign relations those fears  combined with a request from somalias transitional government  led ethiopian forces to enter somalia in december 2006 to remove the icu from power and that move inflamed alshabaab which then attacked ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern somalia according to a 2011 case study by rob wise who was then with the counterterrorism program at the center for strategic and international studies in 2011 after attacks on tourist destinations in northern kenya blamed on alshabaab the kenyan government ordered a crossborder incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern somalia ethiopian troops have also crossed the border and expelled alshabaab from baidoa a strategic town midway between the ethiopian border and mogadishu the group then targeted african union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks a suicide bombing in march 2012 killed five people at the presidential palace analysts say tension appears to have been growing within alshabaab between somalis and foreign fighters several hundred of whom are thought to have entered somalia in recent years to join the group the group has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a twitter account and video production abilities alshabaab has even made a video thats as slickly produced as a reality tv show complete with a hiphop jihad voice and a startling message  mortar by mortar shell by shell only going to stop when i send them to hell an unidentified voice raps in english but alshabaabs enemies  and alliances  can shift abu mansour alamriki a former alshabaab fighter and prolific englishlanguage propagandist for the group said in a video posted online last year that he had had a fallout with alshabaab regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy and feared for his life alamriki whose real name is omar hammami was reportedly killed in somalia by alshabaab cnn was not able to confirm the report finding replacements might not be difficult sheikh ahmed matan a member of britains somali community said he knows of hundreds of young somali men living in the west who returned to somalia for terrorist training alshabaab has also succeeded in recruiting a number of americans to fight in somalia most of whom are from minnesota cnn national security analyst peter bergen wrote in a cnncom column in 2008 the fbi launched operation rhino a serious effort to crack down on anyone traveling to somalia to support alshabaab bergen wrote the onceragtag al qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion illegal taxation and other fees according to the 2011 united nations report the united states believed then that the group was coordinating with al qaeda groups in yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad in 2011 it was generating between 70 million and 100 million per year from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports taxes on goods and services taxes in kind on domestic produce jihad contributions checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation according to the report from the un monitoring group on somalia and eritrea in 2011 the un declared a famine in the southern somalia regions of bakool and lower shabelle and alshabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in faminestricken areas that year the un interagency group for child mortality estimation said somalia had the highest mortality rate in the world for children ages 4 and younger about 258000 somalis died in the famine between october 2010 and april 2012 and half the victims were younger than 5 years old according to a report from the un food and agriculture organization and the usaidfunded famine early warning systems network the united states has supported unbacked african forces fighting alshabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group it has also donated millions of dollars in aid in september 2012 somali parliament members selected hassan sheikh mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation which had not had a stable central government since barres overthrow 21 years earlier but that didnt mean alshabaab was calling it quits in january 2013 french forces attempted to rescue a french intelligence commando held hostage in somalia by the group the raid left the soldier dead another soldier missing and 17 islamist fighters dead but there has been political progress in somalia in january 2013 for the first time in more than two decades the united states granted official recognition to the somali government cnns tim lister barbara starr paula newton david mckenzie and elise labott contributed to this report",
