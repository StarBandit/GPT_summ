gave its side of the story wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day hernandez 25 is on trial for the shooting death of lloyd whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013 now that the defense has rested it wont be long before the jury begins deliberating much of the evidence in the former new england patriots case is circumstantial here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday  as news spread that hernandez was under investigation in june 2013 patriots owner robert kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after lloyds death he said he was not involved kraft testified last week he said he was innocent and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club theres only one potential problem with that claim the time lloyd was killed hadnt been made public yet by the time hernandez met with kraft so how could hernandez have known when lloyd was killed what a great great witness for the prosecution cnn legal analyst mel robbins said basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand when questioned by a defense attorney kraft said that hed never had any problems with hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him hernandezs fiancee shayanna jenkins revealed for the first time last week that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couples home that she said reeked of marijuana she also said she didnt know what was in the box that revelation may contradict the prosecutions contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered during crossexamination by the defense jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled skunky earlier she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didnt know what was in the box she said hernandez never told her and she never looked after concealing the box with her daughters clothing jenkins said she threw it away in a random dumpster but could not remember exactly where much testimony has focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows about 93000 pairs of that shoe were made significantly fewer in a size 13 the shoes sole makes a distinct impression said lt steven bennett of the massachusetts state police the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes  more than 3 million  make the same impression yet bennett who works in crime scene services testified that the footprint left near lloyds body was in agreement or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13 although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night he used an identical pair to make his determination bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison prosecutors used grainy footage from hernandezs home security system to suggest he was holding a 45caliber handgun  the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandezs home in my opinion the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol glock sales manager kyle aspinwall testified the video is timestamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks  the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving hernandezs lawyers then showed a different part of the video timestamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand suggesting it may be an ipad glock pistols dont have white glows to them do they defense attorney james sultan asked no they do not aspinwall answered sultan then displayed a softpellet gun similar in shape to a glock suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding hernandez has pleaded not guilty in lloyds death but already his arrest has led to deep consequences including his release from the new england patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings so what might make a young man who had signed a 40 million contract risk everything prosecutors have said lloyd might have done or said something that didnt sit well with hernandez they claimed hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score hernandezs codefendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately but the case gets more complicated evidence collected in lloyds death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub that double shooting took place in july 2012 almost a year before lloyd was killed prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing lloyd the spot where that double murder happened during trial prosecutors suggest a text written by hernandez the day before the murder saying he was buggin for showing lloyd the spot may have played a role in plotting to kill lloyd the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in lloyds trial ruling it is prejudicial hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well but when the lloyd trial ends that murder trial awaits him cnns jason hanna lawrence crook laura dolan and catherine e shoichet contributed to this report",
        "summ": "The prosecution and defense have both rested in the trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing semi-pro player Odin Lloyd.

pleaded not guilty just two years ago he was one of the nfls most promising tight ends inking a 40million contract extension with the new england patriots friends and fans alike wondered how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder long before hernandez made national headlines he was a standout athlete in bristol connecticut who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty i dont think there was another family that was more familiar in bristol bob montgomery who covers high school sports for the bristol press told cnn the young hernandez was the golden boy playing football basketball and running track following in the footsteps of his uncle older brother and father  all wellknown athletes in the community hernandezs father constantly pushed his son requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends i saw a closeness with them that id never seen before montgomery said of the relationship between hernandez and his father but his father the man who kept the 16yearold anchored died from complications after a routine surgery hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the university of florida gators and trouble seemed to follow in just his first semester a police report says hernandez got into a fight at an offcampus restaurant suckerpunching the manager and rupturing his eardrum the following fall there was a shooting near a local club police reports linked hernandez and several other university of florida football players to an argument in the parking lot hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel at the time hernandezs mother told the orlando sentinel newspaper i know he was at the club but he never saw any shooting the case remains open and no one has been charged hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year trying to put the alleged drug use behind him hernandez wrote a letter to the patriots director of personnel if you draft me as a member of the new england patriots i will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season  in addition i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a prorata amount for any failed drug test he wrote according to the boston globe before the draft hernandez was expected to be a first or secondround pick he was passed over until the fourth round when the patriots selected him by the end of his second season he was a bona fide star landing the 40 million contract extension less than a year after signing the deal however the patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with lloyds murder when odin lloyd pulled up in a black chevrolet suburban boston bandits coach mike branch thought something was out of place lloyd didnt own a car aaron hernandez case whos who branch had his suspicions but he couldnt get answers lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night he said he was at the club with mr hernandez and that they were partying and he had a good time and that mr hernandez spent a good amount of money branch recalled lloyd said hernandez spent about 10000 that night lloyds friends say he wasnt a big partier he was more passionate about football and family remembering odin lloyd  lloyd was dating shaneah jenkins the link between the young man who dreamed of the nfl and the allamerican who made it jenkins is the younger sister of shayanna whos engaged to hernandez and is the mother of his little girl on june 16 2013 lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban which police later learned was rented by hernandez daryl hodge was with lloyd when he said lloyd got a text from hernandez asking to hang out later that night as they parted ways lloyd told hodge hed see him later the next day lloyds body was found prosecutors say lloyd was last seen with hernandez and hernandezs two associates carlos ortiz and ernest wallace around 230 am in a rented silver nissan altima surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an altima heading toward a secluded area at 322 am at the same time chilling text messages from lloyds phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with nfl adding just so u know between 323 and 327 am workers nearby reported hearing gunshots at 329 a camera showed an altima pulling into hernandezs driveway about a half a mile from the death scene three people got out of the car and lloyd was not one of them nine days later hernandez was arrested and charged with firstdegree murder and other weaponsrelated charges he pleaded not guilty in april 2014 ortiz and wallace were also charged in lloyds slaying they too pleaded not guilty prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture a legal term that means its not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in lloyds murder as the trial for the death of lloyd neared lawyers began arguing about evidence including cell phones and text messages some rulings were victories for the defense the jury wouldnt see the text lloyd sent to his sister telling her he was with nfl the judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadnt proven lloyd believed his life was in danger jurors also didnt hear anything about what happened in boston on july 16 2012  the night two men were murdered outside a club where hernandez had been the judge agreed with defense lawyers that its far too prejudicial and irrelevant to

patrick haggan described the scene in a massachusetts courtroom in may saying hernandez became angered and increasingly agitated particularly after mr abreu smiled and did not apologize prosecutors bump spilled drink led to double homicide  hernandezs friend tried to calm him down and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street the prosecutor said court documents identify that friend as alexander bradley who would go on to accuse hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later after leaving the second nightclub hernandez and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block haggan said hernandez began trailing abreu furtado and three of their friends in his suv authorities said he then pulled up to the victims car at a red light and leaned out the drivers side window with a loaded revolver haggan told the court hernandez allegedly said yo whats up now followed by a racial slur and fired at least five rounds from a 38caliber revolver haggan said abreu the driver was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest

setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others in court last month she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street staring at her own bones now jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath but no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain she said i dont believe that there will ever be justice brought to this no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life she said crying as she spoke to reporters outside her texas home i do believe however that he should be held accountable for his actions and im very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that gregory who wrote a widely publicized letter to tsarnaev after testifying said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories but its an important step everything is being brought up again full force our lives will never ever be the same but i hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason that theres a bigger plan she said i may be standing on one fake leg but im standing here stronger than ever because someone tried to destroy me and he failed for gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack wednesdays verdict brought a mix of emotions from triumphant vows to move forward to expressions of gratitude to debate over whether tsarnaev should be sentenced to death there were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in boston in fact there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats as tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head some survivors and victims family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears as cnns alexandra field noted from inside the courtroom theyve waited a long time for this the family of sean collier a 26yearold police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology said tsarnaev and his brother tamerlan were terrorists who failed monumentally in striking fear in people while todays verdict can never bring sean back we are thankful that dzhokhar tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families the collier family said in a written statement to richard dic donohue an mbta police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the tsarnaevs in watertown the verdicts show that as a society  terrorism will not prevail and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation justice has been served today donahue tweeted survivor karen brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal she doesnt believe dzhokhar tsarnaevs brother tamerlan now dead persuaded him to take part in the plot as the defense contended dzhokhar in her view was all in obviously we are grateful for the outcome today brassard tolder reporters its not a happy occasion but its something that we can put one more step behind us that sense of turning the page was echoed by bruce mendelsohn who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line the verdicts mean that dzhokhar tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect  he is now officially a convicted killer you cant call it celebration but there is a newfound peace of mind at least in and around boston this was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt and they got through it by rallying around each other a deep bond reflected in the mantra boston strong that feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by wednesdays verdict and its evident in people like heather abbott who lost her left leg below the knee since then shes become a living example of someone who wasnt stopped by the terror  learning not only to walk again but to run again nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever abbott said wednesday on facebook but at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken that view was commonly shared for those hurt  physically mentally emotionally  by the horrors of 2013 wednesday was key to their progression but its not the end of the road just ask jeff bauman the picture of him bloodied being rushed through the streets of boston by good samaritan carlos arredondo became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack even after losing both his legs bauman has become a symbol since of resilience  moving on with his life by marrying and

thursday ayatollah ali khamenei the islamic republics supreme leader meanwhile told staterun media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it isnt final and hes not certain it will become binding because he has never been optimistic about negotiations with the us six world powers and iran reached a preliminary deal last week that aims to limit tehrans nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic  sanctions the united states however has stressed that if a final deal is reached with iran the removal of any sanctions will come in phases but work on the agreement isnt finished negotiators from iran and the united states china germany france britain and russia have until june 30 to come up with a final deal khamenei said he supports the negotiators but in several notsosubtle shots at the united states noted it is too soon to celebrate the proposed deal everything lies in the details khamenei said in a thursday address according to press tv the other side which is known for backpedaling on its commitments may want to corner our country when it comes to the specifics what has been hashed out so far is no guarantee that the deal will become final he said and according to the islamic republic news agency the leader said he cant support or oppose the deal especially when its possible the other disloyal party intends to limit our country some have asked why khamenei hasnt taken a position on the talks and the reason is simple he said according to irna there is no need to take a position officials say nothing has been done yet and that nothing is binding i am neither in favor nor against it any final deal must ensure the interests and dignity of the iranian nation he said adding he will support an agreement that will safeguard national interests and dignity he said hed rather see the agreement fail than make a deal that jeopardizes irans interests what has happened so far will neither guarantee the agreement itself nor its content it will not even guarantee completion of the negotiations therefore it is meaningless to congratulate me or others about it he said rouhani said his government would not surrender to bullying sanctions and threats according to press tv we will not sign any deal unless on the very first day of its implementation all economic sanctions against iran are lifted all at once rouhani said at  a ceremony to mark national nuclear technology day in tehran president barack obama faces an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical congress which has threatened to impose new sanctions on iran us energy secretary ernest moniz a nuclear physicist and negotiator with iran estimated it would take six months after a final deal is signed for the sanctions to be lifted he told cnns christiane amanpour that it was a ballpark figure contingent on a lot of work the iranians will have to do beforehand the core nuclear provisions must be satisfied  the provisions that give us our confidence moniz said he said its in the hands of the iranians to fulfill steps such as reducing stockpiles and lowering the number of operating centrifuges it will depend on their ability to execute those moves moniz said asked if the iranians were aware of that time frame during the negotiations  before rouhani called for the immediate lifting of sanctions  moniz said oh yes for sure the no 3 house republican leader said a bill to ease any sanctions does not stand much of a chance in the us house of representatives or senate the sanctions that were put in place  again very bipartisan sanctions passed by congress years ago that were effective  the only way to get rid of them completely would be for congress to vote to ease those sanctions rep steve scalise of louisiana said in a radio interview with wwl in new orleans on wednesday we havent had that vote i dont see that passing out of the house i dont even think it would pass out of the senate right now diplomats announced last week that theyd come up with the framework for an agreement after a marathon stretch of latenight negotiations in lausanne switzerland the framework includes the easing of us and un sanctions on iran if it takes certain steps to curb its nuclear program iran would reduce its stockpile of lowenriched uranium by 98 for 15 years and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges according to the plan in exchange the united states and the european union would lift sanctions that have crippled the countrys economy it is a good deal a deal that meets our core objectives obama said after it was announced april 2 this framework would cut off every pathway that iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon it would include strict verification measures to make sure iran complies he said the united states and iran have a long history of strained relations which made the negotiations more significant just two years ago the two countries had not talked with each other officially in nearly four decades cnns eliott c mclaughlin christine theodorou  and catherine e shoichet contributed to this report",

towing company employee that made me bring it up one of the main things i preach to my girls ages 7 and 9 is the importance of respecting other people no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish its something that my husband and i just do  we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the president of the united states let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time whether its been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant in those cases when i feel like im going to pop i keep saying this is unacceptable this is unacceptable and either hang up in disgust or storm off not perfect ways of handling these incidents but at no time would i ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations some of mchenrys comments such as how shes on television imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she by dint of her career education and income is better than people who dont get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities mchenry showed that she either forgot those golden rule lessons from childhood or that she hasnt really lived her life with that mantra mchenry has since apologized on twitter saying she said some insulting and regrettable things and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in virginia  she should always choose to be respectful and take the high road but its not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker i see this britt mchenry video and think its not just about how a celebrity shouldnt act in public its how all of us shouldnt act wrote cait on twitter said shannon also on twittter i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but  now i know shes the kind of woman i hope ive taught my daughters not to be her language and disdain brings shame on her her profession and her employer people dont all of sudden have such a vile tirade this comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors lets let her be an example to others wrote c cooper on a changeorg petition asking mchenrys employers to fire her the mchenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her this morning i told her mchenry was suspended for a week by espn and that led to another conversation my kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to treat other people the way you would want them to treat you even in uncomfortable moments celebrity apologies the good bad and uncomfortable  so britt mchenry check out these examples of how the rich famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity after british journalist katie hopkins seriously fatshamed pop music star kelly clarkson saying a host of insulting things about the singers weight clarkson won praise for her graceful response thats because she doesnt know me im awesome it doesnt bother me its a free world say what you will ive just never cared what people think she said a college baseball player gets suspended for calling little league baseball phenom mone davis a slut her response she emailed bloomsburg university asking that the college reinstate him everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance davis the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in little league world series history told espn  i know right now hes really hurt and i know how hard he worked to get where he is i mean i was pretty hurt on my part but i know hes hurting even more when an argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to pope francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the countrys president ahead of the general election in october and possibly influencing the outcome what did the pope do well he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation the pope appears to have been more than graceful because after the conversation the journalist pledged to learn how to pray when queen bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lipsynching the national anthem in honor of president obamas inauguration in 2013 she didnt come out swinging instead she admitted to singing along with her prerecorded track at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring a cappella rendition of the national anthem finally reese witherspoon may be the closest example for mchenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode when witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence the academy award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as do you know who i am and youre about to find out who i am she ultimately issued an apologetic statement and then went on morning television to apologize some more we went out to dinner in atlanta and we had one too many glasses of wine and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not she said on good morning america its completely unacceptable and we are so sorry and embarrassed we know better and we shouldnt have done that and she added when a police officer tells you to stay in the car you stay in the car i learned that for sure she told the gma host  now did mchenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry you never berate them for their weight job appearance and income lets hope so can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect share your thoughts with kelly

The author argues that the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the American intervention in Iraq not only paved the way for abuses like Abu Ghraib and Blackwater, it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country.

nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers the april 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on mount everest the deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the sherpas and the dangers of climbing everest in order to reduce risks the route through khumbu icefall the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer theyre going in the icefall and as we found out on april 18 its the most dangerous place said conrad anker a veteran climber who has been to everest three times theyre exposed to the tumbling ice hanging seracs above it its very very dangerous its the most dangerous place ive been in the mountains at this point in the season climbing teams have not yet entered khumbu icefall which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb mount everest with 125 of them from the previously shortened season according to the nepal ministry of tourism  its a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year the local nepalese committee that determines the path up everest announced in february that a different route had been selected the climbers will now take a central route through the khumbu icefall avoiding the area where the deaths occurred the committee comprised of sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons there will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left said yangji doma sherpa the spokeswoman for the sagarmatha pollution control committee the central route had been used in the 1990s but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route she said the new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses and use more vertical and horizontal ladders the committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders i think it will be an hour longer on the icefall said alan arnette who is blogging from everest base camp this season i dont think it will be game changer but one company alpenglow expeditions said it would stop climbing from the nepal side where the climbers have to go through the icefall in favor of the northern route from china weve seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years said  adrian ballinger the companys founder and ceo we believe the risk is too great for our workers according to the china tibet mountaineering association 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to everest this year thats 136 more than last year the chinese side of everest has typically been less popular than its nepal counterpart because of concerns of government closures some everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain but it also doesnt have an icefall the increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst nepali companies that climbers will divert to the chinese side i can already see the shift with mountaineers i speak to said dawa steven sherpa who is based in nepal more people are going to go to tibet than nepal nepal needs the tourism far more than china does china has incredible wealth of resources and nepal does not leading expeditions is how sherpas feed their families and send their children to school nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year and while they may be ready to return to the summit their families are not many of them are leaving behind nervous stressedout wives and children whose memories of what happened last year are fresh said dawa sherpa managing director of asian trekking they do say they dont want to put them through that again he said theyre not fearful for their own lives its what theyre putting their family through several mountaineers are also returning this year one of them is jon reiter who spoke to cnn last year after the tragedy when the icy avalanche thundered down reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his sherpa guide reiter who is making his way to base camp this year could not be reached directly but he explained why hes heading back to everest this year on his blog i cant quite find the words to tell you why or what really pulls me back to the mountains he wrote when we were in the midst of last years events it was hard to see the big picture it was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that its more rare than not it was hard for me to remember that im not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains i like to think its similar to surviving a plane crash

peaceful after a marathon stretch of latenight negotiations in lausanne switzerland diplomats announced theyd come up with the framework for an agreement thats been months in the making iran would reduce its stockpile of lowenriched uranium by 98 and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges according to the plan in exchange the united states and the european union would lift sanctions that have crippled the countrys economy it is a good deal a deal that meets our core objectives us president barack obama said in a speech from the white house rose garden this framework would cut off every pathway that iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon the deal would include strict verification measures to make sure iran complies he said if iran cheats obama said the world will know it key points of the deal  the world powers involved in the talks with iran were the united states russia china france the united kingdom and germany for the united states and iran two countries with a long history of strained relations the negotiations took on an added significance just two years ago they hadnt talked with each other officially in nearly four decades i think there was a seriousness of purpose us secretary of state john kerry told cnn in an interview shortly after the framework was announced people negotiated hard it was tough very intense at times sometimes emotional and confrontational it was a very intensive process because the stakes are very high and because there is a long history of not talking to each other for 35 years we havent talked with the iranians directly like this on thursday iranian state television broadcast obamas speech live something many iranians described as unprecedented some iranians marked the historic moment in usiranian relations on twitter by sharing selfies of themselves in front of the live obama speech but us leaders were still talking tough even as they praised the agreement kerry stressed that if a final deal is reached with iran the removal of any sanctions against tehran will come in phases and if we find out at any point that iran is not complying with the agreement the sanctions can snap back into place he said iran didnt seem to be changing its tune either iranus relations had nothing to do with this this was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue  we have serious differences with the united states foreign minister javad zarif said after the deals framework was announced noting that mutual mistrust had been a serious problem in the talks the preliminary agreement will not put an end to irans enrichment activities zarif said none of those measures include closing any of our facilities the proud people of iran would never accept that he said but he said iran will abide by the agreement which would limit enrichment activities to one location he said 21 questions on iranian nuclear talks  but work on the deal isnt finished theres a june 30 deadline for coming up with a final agreement in the united states the obama administration could face an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical congress which has threatened to impose new sanctions on iran already there were rumblings of the looming political fight kerry said he didnt believe congress would block the deal telling cnn it would be very irresponsible to make politics trump facts and science and the realities of what is possible here house speaker john boehner said in a statement that he was planning to stand strong and press the administration with tough questions the president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the white houses initial goals he said arguing that congress must review details of a deal before any sanctions are lifted obama warned leaders of congress not to stop the deal if congress kills this deal not based on expert analysis and without offering any reasonable alternative then its the united states that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy obama said international unity will collapse obama maintains the deal would shut down irans path to getting a nuclear bomb but israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu says the opposite is true such a deal would not block irans path to the bomb it would pave it he said in a statement it would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war netanyahu has been lobbying against an agreement since the talks began warning us lawmakers in a congressional address last month that iran cant be trusted israeli government officials vowed to continue their push against what they called a poor framework that will lead to a bad and dangerous agreement if an agreement is reached on the basis of this framework it will result in a historic mistake that will make the world a far more dangerous place the israeli officials said in a statement this framework gives international legitimacy to irans nuclear program that aims only to produce nuclear bombs obama said that he was reaching out to netanyahu to explain and defend the tentative framework if in fact prime minister netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure that iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon this is the best option obama said negotiations between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council  china france russia the united kingdom and the united states  plus germany began in 2006 and have had a tortured history over the past nine years the push and pull over irans nuclear program produced a bewildering array of proposals meanwhile as talks dragged on the united states the european union and others imposed sanctions on iran provoking resentment among tehrans leaders who called the sanctions a crime against humanity the challenge all along was twofold to assure the international community that iran could not develop nuclear weapons which it denied in any event that it was doing and to accommodate the countrys assertion of its right  as a signer of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons  to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes the broad outlines of a deal seem to have been clear for some time but the devil was in the details and the numbers timing sequencing and verification procedures proved devilishly difficult to resolve until now the 2013 election of hassan rouhani a political moderate to irans presidency infused the talks with new hope though questions lingered over whether he could persuade the countrys hardliners to accept an agreement us leaders also were divided over the agreement as envisioned in a march 9 letter signed by 47 republican us senators irans leaders were warned that any deal not approved by the senate could immediately be revoked by president barack obamas successor in 2017 democrats denounced the sending of such a letter to foreign leaders as an unprecedented intervention in negotiations between the administration and another country and irans leaders also dismissed the letter  cnns elise labott reported from lausanne and mariano castillo and catherine e shoichet wrote

chess iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices all the while convincing ourselves that americas policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track iran isnt 10 feet tall in this region but by making the nuclear issue the beall and endall that is supposed to reduce irans power the united states is only making tehran taller consider the following  the usiranian relationship is not symmetrical its not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors iran is about to try a us citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from irans serial abuse of human rights including  the behavior of its shia militias in iraq i can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behindthescenes plan to have iran release jason rezaian if not were legitimizing a bad regime and compromising us values and interests  in the process by not ensuring that all americans being held by iran come out as part of the nuclear deal america is alienating some of our closest allies because of the iran deal and iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see irans power rising our friends arent perfect particularly the saudis and even the israelis but we need them precisely because iran is rising sadly the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities in the meantime irans allies bashar alassads syria hezbollah and now the houthis  not proxies but instruments of convenience  see whats happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the iranian game the russians too realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency were  losing friends iran is gaining them and in one of the cruelest ironies irans way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah the nuclear issue as the arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power egypt iraq syria iran is rising the argument here is not that iran is taking over the middle east but in its zone of influence a zone critical to the united states  syria iraq the gulf yemen lebanon  it is expanding its influence not contracting washington doesnt play this kind of game well it is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat isis in syria and yet not empower alassad no answer how to combat isis in iraq without favoring the shiadominated government and alienating iraqi sunnis no answerand how to backstop the saudis in yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes no answer iran has a much easier time managing contradictions indeed it can use the threat of isis to keep the americans away from weakening their ally alassad as well as expand its influence in iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest battle group naval assets to the gulf of aden notwithstanding the united states is being outfoxed not outgunned dont expect us ships to stop those of iran as state department spokesperson marie harf said there are reports about these us ships that have been moved and i want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression they are not there to intercept iranian ships the purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe i think there was some misreporting and confusion on this i just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those iranian ships it clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain irans nuclear program but we should have no illusions about two things first we wont end teherans nuclear weapons pretensions and two we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy not constraining it  one of the reasons the united states wont strike alassad is for fear of emboldening isis but the other is that we dont want a proxy war with iran in syria as the russians have made clear in their recent s300 deal the nuclear negotiations are only making iran a more acceptable business partner and the real fruits of the diplomacy havent even begun yet sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up not tamp down their regional aspirations weve made our bed apparently and now are going to have to find a way to sleep a nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now but unless it really does change irans behavior weve only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road",

small and unusual living space is all that this employed single mother can afford in her highcost community in san mateo california nicole isnt alone in her struggles cnn recently published a powerful piece called poor kids of silicon valley that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the bay area  one aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people including 11 children  another chronicles a husband and wife named rich and stacey both of whom have jobs who are living in a san jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they dont have the money to go anywhere else although silicon valley has unique characteristics it isnt the only community confronting these challenges  our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis  the agency i lead the us department of housing and urban development recently released a report estimating that 77 million lowincome households live in substandard housing spend more than half their incomes on rent or both these are families who are dedicating 1 out of every 2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head  and the more they spend on housing the less they have to invest in their childrens education build up savings and shop at local businesses  these are outcomes that hurt our nations economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action hud is working with local partners across the country to do just that first were focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists since the mid1970s we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700000 affordable units  but by 2020 were in danger of losing more than 125000 because these mortgages are maturing ending agreements to control rents in these units  so weve launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come were also doing the same with public housing right now the nation is losing 10000 units of public housing every year mainly because of disrepair hud created the rental assistance demonstration  initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good its cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as lexington north carolina where the local housing authority is making 58 years worth of repairs in just 22 months including new lighting modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs rad has allowed local communities to raise more than 733 million in new capital to date thats why were asking congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program no american should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home in addition to preservation hud is also working to create new affordable housing  a harvard study revealed that in 2012 there were 115 million extremely lowincome households and only 33 million affordable units available  its clear that we cant preserve our way out of this problem  weve got to grow the supply to meet demand so hud is taking a multifaceted approach for example our home investment partnerships program is leveraging 4 in private and other public resources for every 1 in home funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families this is more than just a statistic it is progress for people from the families living in the broadway crossing development in washington to the seniors living in the woodcrest retirement residence in pennsylvania  to keep this momentum going weve asked congress to increase home funding by 16 to keep building affordable homes prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation we are also asking congress to expand our housing choice voucher program which allows recipients of modest means the elderly and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market  this includes restoring 67000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration and were targeting our resources where they can have a big impact for instance hud awarded 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the san francisco bay area including silicon valley in january  and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment to empower communities president barack obama has also requested 300 million for new local housing policy grants to help them increase housing affordability economic growth and access to jobs all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coasttocoast our nations affordable housing challenges wont be solved overnight and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper lets not squander this chance to make real progress for american families incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners i know we can build a future where affordable housing is

next day would be like as a coowner of charmingtons a cafe in the intersection of three major baltimore neighborhoods rothschild knew that the cafe and its workers needed to support the city after all the unrest there was some fear but it was really mixed in with an overwhelming sense that everyone here needs help she said as protests erupt nationwide after the death of freddie gray a black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody some local businesses in baltimore are banding together to show their support for the city while others are left to rebuild or repair after mondays riot late monday evening over email rothschild  and other workers from charmingtons decided that the cafe would remain closed on tuesday so that staff members could spend the day in the community to help clean up or peacefully protest 45 cvs workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores  the following morning they posted a sign on the door telling patrons they were closed to partake in community action the cafe was not in mondays protest zone we shut down not out of fear but for solidarity rothschild said it was solidarity for baltimore for the black lives matter movement and for the local businesses that were destroyed during the rioting the fiveyear baltimore resident explained with a warm steaming crock pot of chicken and a cooler of ice water charmingtons staff member mike dobson made his way down to the center of the rallying tuesday and set up a stand it was one of a handful of businesses passing out free food and water to protesters the movement in baltimore is personal for dobson the 23yearold has been out on the streets peacefully demonstrating and offering free food every day since protests first started i have witnessed police brutality i was roughed up by police before it is something you dont have to look very far to witness in west baltimore he said the decision for charmingtons to close temporarily  it has since reopened  was meaningful dobson said our shop has been a part of the community since it opened and we thought it was important to be a part of the community especially now the feeling on baltimores streets has changed dramatically over the past few days its now peaceful and somewhat celebratory dobson said there have been protests but there have also been celebrations of all us together and you cant have a celebration without food he said not all businesses fared well some suffered major losses trevira londons store london couture boutique on fleet street was ransacked monday her windows were smashed and her merchandised looted they wiped me out the 36yearold said she understands the frustration and can see why some local businesses are joining the movement to stand with their city but shes also depressed that her business one that she opened only four months ago was destroyed in the wake of the unrest and there are reports that the weeklong curfew is affecting smaller businesses this is not a black or white issue this has been going on decades but there are ways to protest without hurting people destroying buildings and looting london said in the meantime she is thinking about boarding up her storefront just to be safe other businesses outside the major protest zones stayed open to be a resource for the community this past week john duda an owner and worker at the cooperative restaurant and bookstore red emmas decided to stay open after the upheaval on monday when  workers heard that schools were going to be closed tuesday they felt the need to keep their door opens in order to provide free meals to students and those who are the most vulnerable in the city we saw it on social media that people were trying to figure out how to feed school children who depend on school lunches and we thought we could stand in solidarity with folks the 37yearold said the response was incredible he said not only were students coming in for free lunches but baltimore residents were coming by to see whether they could volunteer and offer their support i was initially a little concerned that the reaction and the unrest on monday would take away from important issues facing the city duda said but he has seen residents of the city step up to show their support for not only freddie gray but the need to address social and economic disparities in the city it has inspired the 12year baltimore resident and business owner to start peacefully protesting as well on wednesday with the sun setting in the background duda marched with a group down the streets of baltimore the scene was beautiful duda said red emmas is normally closed during the 10 pm to 5 am curfew with the exception of having to close an hour early this friday and saturday charmingtons is not normally open during the curfew hours duda said many of the people marching werent just marching for freddie gray they were also marching for better education and work opportunities duda said these people have been voicing their frustrations for years but it seems like now they are finally being heard it took the city to almost tear itself apart for it to start coming together",

        "article": "cnn my name is mark goodacre and i am a professor of new testament and christian origins in the department of religious studies at duke university i was series adviser and one of many oncamera experts on cnns finding jesus i also appeared in each episode of the program viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the finding jesus facebook page during the season finale about mary magdalene below are some of the most interesting and my answers to them they have been edited for style and clarity for this article  anarie kennedy the copy we have of the gospel of mary magdalene comes from the second century but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older like first century goodacre actually the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century it is currently located in berlin germany although its our most complete manuscript it is missing several pages there are two other fragments of the gospel of mary both in greek and both dating from the third century it is difficult to date the gospel itself one of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century gustavo odr\u00eda  where can we get a good translation of the gospel of mary magdalene goodacre there are several good translations of the gospel of mary one suggestion is karen kings the gospel of mary of magdala jesus and the first woman apostle that book also has good introduction and discussion materials one thing that is worth adding is that the gospel is not actually called the gospel of mary magdalene the term magdalene does not come at all in the texts we have of the gospel the heroine is simply called mary edward james reeves i would like to know what really happened to mary magdalene where did she go who last saw her goodacre this is one of the great mysteries about the character she is so prominent at the end of each of the canonical gospels and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the new testament but there is nothing she is not mentioned in acts of the apostles or in pauls letters or anywhere else one possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle but if that is the case it is surprising that the gospel writers pay so much attention to her in their passion and resurrection narratives another possibility and we touched on this in the episode is that mary died not long after the events narrated in the gospels perhaps she was a wealthy elderly widow turnbullteacher wouldnt church fathers writing in the second century have written if jesus was married or not goodacre thats a good question there is actually nothing in second century writers that says that jesus was married and clement of alexandria died 215 ad takes for granted that jesus was not married when the gospel of jesus wife was published in 2012 it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of jesus being married from as early as the second century but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery anna585858 do you think magdalene is a nickname or reference to marys hometown goodacre its a good guess that magdalene refers to magdala and so her name would refer to her hometown just as jesus the nazarene is from nazareth there are other characters in the new testament who are identified by their hometowns for example simon of cyrene and joseph of arimathea you are right though that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with magdala allsaintsradio why was the gospel of mary magdalene left out of the canon of 66 biblical books goodacre this is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention the gospel of mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early christian works but in any case the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with matthew mark luke and john all of which are written by the end of the first or at the latest the beginning of the second century further the gospel of marys theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical gospels stephanoledreed where is it said that jesus had a wife goodacre there are no ancient texts in which jesus had a wife the closest we get to the idea is the gospel of philip in which mary magdalene is described as jesus companion one of three women who always walked with the lord the same gospel says that jesus used to kiss her often but we dont know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point however the gospel of philip is probably too late late second to midthird century to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical mary magdalene funding jesus who bankrolled christs ministry i would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks sorry that fellow oncamera expert candida moss and i could not get to all of them thanks too for all the encouraging words about finding jesus we are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it if you would like to explore these issues in more detail perhaps i might recommend my podcast the nt pod which you can find on itunes or at httppodacreblogspotcom",

headscarf with several shopping bags as she stood outside the barricaded entrance to one of istanbuls busiest subway stations she was one of millions of turks left confused and concerned by the worst power outage to grip the country in more than a decade dozens of cities across turkey lost power for hours on tuesday millions of people were affected including passengers stranded on paralyzed trains and subways municipal workers were forced to evacuate istanbuls marmaray tunnel where the blackout left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the bosphorus strait more than 24 hours later turkish officials were still at pains to explain the power outage the energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines the prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack the mysterious collapse of much of the countrys energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media some twitter users went so far as to suggest the blackouts were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in june there is fertile ground for rumormongering in turkey over the last five years security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals journalists prosecutors civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government the governments increasingly heavyhanded repression of public dissent combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet have also contributed to a hyperpolarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere even turkeys veteran deputy prime minister bulent arinc recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him with hatred rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002 meanwhile mysterious blackouts are a sore spot for some turks after a surreal 2014 incident on election night  allegedly involving a feline saboteur that is  a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer that was almost exactly a year ago a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging the ruling justice and development party ended up winning by a comfortable margin but few turks were reassured by the energy ministers explanation that the voting day blackouts were caused by a cat getting lost as electricity was just starting to come back on in istanbul on tuesday a second crisis erupted websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the dhkpc began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the palace of justice the monolithic court house in the center of istanbul there they took hostage mehmet selim kiraz the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country the gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at berkin elvan a 15yearold boy who was critically wounded during antigovernment protests that raged across istanbul in 2013 the boys death after months in a medicallyinduced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government on tuesday in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house the turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the palace of justice siege the broadcast ban is a measure that the turkish government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks the government also famously shut down twitter and youtube in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption ultimately tuesdays court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded turkish officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting online and in the streets some turks began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostagetaking inside one of turkeys bestprotected buildings even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected just hours after the shooting tensions exploded yet again at the court house istanbuls police chief had called for a press conference as journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse some bystanders began chanting government thieves just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the palace of justice police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government the reactions to tuesdays bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary turkey the country is tense and confused after years of backtoback political crises heavyhanded censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society and the absence of a common credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the arab spring in 2011 turkey was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the middle east  many of those arab countries have since descended into conflict repression and instability in the meantime turkey feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making",

children and barely a third grade education she thought there was no way out what began as psychological torment namecalling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe cifuentes feared for her life one day two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her they probably would have succeeded but after the first bullet was fired cifuentes two sons dragged her inside still in her deeply conservative community it took neighbors two hours to call for help and cifuentes lost her arm but the abuse didnt stop there when she returned home cifuentes husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left thats when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began cifuentes case is dramatic but in guatemala where nearly 10 out of every 100000 women are killed its hardly unusual a 2012 small arms survey says genderbased violence is at epidemic levels in guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide according to the united nations two women are killed there every day there are many reasons why beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the countrys 36yearold civil war during the conflict atrocities were committed against women who were used as a weapon of war in 1996 a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions many remain in power and they have not changed the way they view women some 200000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decadeslong conflict most of them from indigenous mayan populations nearly 20 years later according to the security sector reform resource centre levels of violent crime are  higher in guatemala than they were during the war but despite the high homicide rate the united nations estimates 98 of cases never make it to court women are particularly vulnerable because of a deeprooted gender bias and culture of misogyny in many cases femicide  the killing of a woman simply because of her gender  is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war including rape torture and mutilation mexican drug cartels organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness  authorities investigating drugrelated killings are stretched thin leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides in many cases crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation many consider the guatamalen national civil police or pnc corrupt underresourced and ineffective even if a case does get prosecuted according to human rights watch the countrys weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in guatemala is the countrys deeply rooted patriarchal society according to mar\u00eda machicado ter\u00e1n the representative of un women in guatemala 80 of men believe that women need permission to leave the house and 70 of women surveyed agreed this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence rights groups say machismo not only condones violence it places the blame on the victim the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize politicians dont think women are important says former secretary general of the presidential secretariat for women elizabeth quiroa political parties use women for elections they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty many girls especially in indigenous communities dont go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far quiroa says they are subject to rape violence and forced participation in the drug trade although the situation for girls and women in guatemala is alarming there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing  with the help of an organization known as cicam or centro de investigaci\u00f3n cifuentes was finally able to escape her  husband and get the justice she deserved he is now spending 27 years behind bars cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art since 2008 she and four other abuse survivors known as la poderosas or the powerful have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly but it also offers suggestions for change and its having an impact women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support men are reacting too one of the main characters lesbia t\u00e9llez says  during one presentation a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated he said he wanted to be different the taboo topic of genderbased violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of guatemalas most vulnerable groups indigenous mayan girls  in 2004 with help from the united nations and other organizations the population council launched a communitybased club known as abriendo oportunidades or opening opportunities the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential senior program coordinator alejandra colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time they realize they are entitled to certain rights colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence the guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women in 2008 the congress passed a law against femicide two years later the attorney generals office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women in 2012 the government established a joint task force for crimes against women making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need the government has also established a special 24hour court to attend to femicide cases on the global front the international violence against women act was introduced in the us congress in 2007 it has been pending ever since but last week the act was reintroduced in both the house and senate if approved it would make reducing levels of genderbased violence a us foreign policy priority pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations which are on the front lines of the fight against genderbased discrimination in guatemala ben weingrod a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group care says we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence  our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women but the job is far from over while there is tempered optimism and hope for change the problem of genderbased violence in guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors which has allowed her to move forward but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures for them its a race against time and help cannot

        "article": "cnn president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president reaching a good solid agreement with iran is a worthy desirable goal but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations weakening americas hand and strengthening iran obamas political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager even desperate side in these talks even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions the country whose only significant export oil lost more than half of its value in recent months the reason is that obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b few believe it particularly in the middle east and notably among americas arab friends who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it iran is having a great obama administration thats a belief that has already started shaking up the region saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped and there is little doubt that other countries among irans muslim rivals will do the same in fact the notion that obama is not handling the iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen where saudi arabia and other arabs are trying to push back against gains by irans allies we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in 2007 when thensen obama said he would meet irans leaders without preconditions leading his rival hillary clinton to call the idea irresponsible and frankly naive as the years of his presidency unfolded and the middle east started coming apart finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after obamas march 31 deadline the usimposed deadline served only to pressure the united states and the french ambassador very publicly decried as a bad tactic that bad tactic was a political move a push to produce some sort of result however vague to protect the talks from critics again a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development but the agreement so far does not look promising it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what obama had vowed in a presidential debate in 2012 obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations the deal well accept is they end their nuclear program its very straightforward nobody is talking about iran ending its nuclear program not even close iran will be allowed to keep onethird of its more than 6000 centrifuges thats not a small symbolic number and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled although fordow will contain no nuclear materials iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses the fact is that iran has a wellestablished record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to un inspectors and the un agency chief says that has not stopped a couple of weeks ago with days left until the negotiating deadline un nuclear chief yukiya amano said iran is still stonewalling we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is for a peaceful purpose he warned the negotiations starting point is that iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible  and preferably forever the world only learned about irans secret facilities at arak and natanz after dissidents raised the alarm iran we have learned repeatedly is very good at lying to international inspectors it is wellestablished that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program it is wellestablished that many of irans neighbors dont trust it and are anxious about the usled international dealings with iran it is wellestablished that iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table it was iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks but political considerations turned the united states into the supplicant the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon nuclear enrichment will continue although at a lower level iran officially legally becomes a nuclear threshold state with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a breakout period of one year the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act even the fordow facility conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain will remain in existence though converted to a nuclear research facility and without nuclear material on site international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place even if operating at a reduced pace giving iran much of what it wanted with iranian forces gaining ground in arab lands and iranian commanders declaring the destruction of israel nonnegotiable and threatening saudi arabia this deal does not look reassuring obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option but the deal so far looks like another win for iran it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the middle east",
        "summ": "President Obama has been pushing for a nuclear deal with Iran since the early days of his presidency, but the process has been marred by political considerations.  The recently announced framework agreement falls short of what Obama had originally promised, and many believe it gives too much away to Iran.  The agreement has already caused tensions in the region, with Saudi Arabia and other countries vowing to pursue nuclear weapons if they believe Iran has not been stopped."

        "article": "cnn if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself the answer of course would be no yet for decades many have stood by the belief that such programs known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs promote and encourage drug use indeed for congress it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in 1988 that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs but an overwhelming body of scientific evidence continues to show that this is simply not true as a result of the recent spikes in hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural indiana and kentucky the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again and this time scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two bloodborne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes this is a welcome step  an estimated 50000 americans are newly infected with hiv every year and some 8 are among injection drug users meanwhile between 2006 and 2012 at least 30 states experienced increases in hepatitis c infection rates with more than half reporting at least a 200 increase in acute infections among young adults overall the prevalence of acute hepatitis c among people under 30 rose from 36 to 49 in six years with such numbers in mind the recent national spotlight on syringe services programs offers a critical opportunity for us to reignite a muchneeded conversation dozens of studies have demonstrated conclusively how effective syringe services programs have been in the fight against hiv and hepatitis c transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of dirty syringes  without increasing drug use in addition to helping curb the spread of these diseases by offering access to sterile syringes these programs promote public health and safety by taking syringes off the streets and protecting law enforcement personnel and others including children from injuries they also offer preventive health services such as hiv testing and counseling and form vital bridges to drug treatment overdose prevention housing and employment services for states such as new york and washington  early adopters of these interventions  syringe services programs have played a crucial role in driving down hiv transmission among injecting drug users washington was the first state in the united states to implement an syringe exchange when it opened a syringe services program in tacoma in 1988 in new york city  where half of all injection drug users were hiv positive in the 1980s  state lawmakers authorized syringe exchange in 1992 to combat the disease deeming it a public health necessity the expansion of these programs in new york was followed by a dramatic reduction in hiv incidence among injecting drug users declining from 54 in 1990 to 13 in 2001 hepatitis c prevalence declined from 90 to 63 during this period because they work syringe services programs will likely be an integral part of the statewide plans announced by new york gov andrew cuomo and washington gov jay inslee to reduce new hiv infections dramatically by 2020 syringe exchange programs not only save lives but also save millions of dollars in hiv treatment costs while a clean syringe costs less than 50 cents the average lifetime cost of treating an hivpositive person is estimated to be around 425000 as hivpositive injection drug users report higher levels of unemployment and homelessness public programs such as medicaid will ultimately become responsible for the expensive treatment costs for example an analysis by johns hopkins university researchers showed that expanding the availability of syringe services programs to cover just 10 of all injections in the united states would prevent almost 500 new hiv infections among drug users per year this translates into 193 million in savings reaped from averted treatment costs after an estimated 64 million investment in other words every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves between 3 and 7 in hiv treatment costs alone despite such evidence syringe services programs are continually caught in the political crossfire a longstanding ban temporarily lifted in 2009 and then reinstated by congress as part of 2010 budget negotiations prevents state and local jurisdictions from spending their federal health dollars on these programs lifting the ban will not cost any additional money  it simply allows states to spend their federally allocated dollars on syringe services programs if they choose to do so why is this important the federal government provides the majority of funding for all hiv prevention services without access to federal funding more than 200 syringe service programs in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico are operating on shoestring budgets from local and state governments this has forced syringe services programs across the country to cut staff scale down services and potentially shut their doors for good meanwhile the new hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in primarily rural states such as in indiana or kentucky show that the landscape

are so many doctors appointments copays surgeries prescriptions  and then the inability to work  any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly she did all she could to help  after her friend passed away farleyberens helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances since 2006 singleton moms has provided practical financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the phoenix area do you know a hero nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015  tiffany montgomery 48 was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage4 breast cancer farleyberens group pitched in to help so montgomery could spend more time with her daughter ezri now 10 when you cant really do much and youre looking at the dirt on the floor its one more level of stress she said  you have these people that come in that dont know you and youre going to help me with cleaning my house singleton moms has actually changed my whole outlook they care about you and theyre demonstrating their love through their actions i sat down with farleyberens to ask her about her work below is an edited version of our conversation cnn tell me about the woman who inspired your work farleyberens  i grew up with a girl named michelle singleton who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30  she was a single mother of four children and i was a young mom with two kids and it was scary you just want to be there to watch them grow up paying the bills cleaning her home making dinner for her kids  all of that became a real struggle i wanted to make things as easy as possible for her so when i would go to the store id grab an extra tide and extra toilet paper when i would make my meals for my family i would double it and bring a meal over to her house  once i helped with an electric bill  i just tried to do those little things that i hoped would relieve her of some stress about six months after she passed we got to thinking she couldnt have been the only one there were other people like her that needed help  and thats how singleton moms was born cnn id imagine that many people havent thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer  how are you able to help farleyberens we focus on daytoday support  financial assistance housecleaning prepared meals supplies for the home kids events its that oldfashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors who doesnt like a clean house that they didnt have to clean themselves we have a team of volunteers that have all been backgroundchecked and they sweep mop clean the bathrooms we even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes and so our parents can come home from chemo sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about ugh the bathroom needs to be cleaned  its just to allow them to focus on whats important which is their health and their family cnn is this work hard for you sometimes on a personal level farleyberens about 80 of the parents we support are stage 4 which means that battling cancer is their fulltime job they will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives theyll be in treatment its hard  its a rollercoaster  ive had bouts when a certain mom has passed where i didnt get out of bed for two weeks and i thought why am i doing this  but then i come back and remember why and so while michelle is and always will be our inspiration there are now so many others that are just as inspirational theyre why i keep doing what i do cnn we should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate farleyberens were not just about moms  we have dads too not a lot but if you are a single parent you need the support  they tend to even get a little special treatment  everybodys like oh theres a dad here  and so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them cnn  its such a serious subject but your group seems to have a very fun vibe farleyberens were very social  once a month all of our families come to pick up their supplies  we do crafts with the kids snacks and have a good time  we like having any event because cancer sucks and theres not a lot of happy that goes with that but life does still go on so its really important that these families can just destress and have fun no one can understand what theyre going through like another single parent with cancer so giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful cancer can be so defeating  its an ugly word and its a sad word  and so its my hope that singleton moms can bring joy and say to cancer you cant defeat us  we are still going to be strong and were going to celebrate life  and you cant take that away from us want to get involved check out the singleton moms website at wwwsingletonmomsorg and see how to help",

        "summ": "The article discusses a recent poll that found that most Americans believe businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples in the same way they would to any other customer, even if it goes against the business's religious beliefs. The poll results are a shift from a similar poll conducted last year, which found that slightly less than half of Americans believed businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples. The change in opinion may be due to recent controversy over a law in Indiana that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples."

        "article": "cnn in july of 2013 the oldest of jesus relics stories rose again when turkish archaeologists discovered a stone chest in a 1350yearold church that appeared to contain a piece of jesus cross we have found a holy thing in a chest it is a piece of a cross said excavation team leader g\u00fclg\u00fcn k\u00f6ro\u011flu an art historian and archaeologist at the time she thought the chest served as a symbolic coffin for a holy persons relics  ones connected to jesus crucifixion and then silence the latest relic of the cross on which jesus had died stalled out because as k\u00f6ro\u011flu later said the box that had contained allegedly holy objects was now  mysteriously  empty the latest episode of the true cross a powerful identifier for the faith of more than two billion people is symbolic of the pitfalls in the hunt for jesus relics to say something smacks of the true cross can mean its a matter of divine certainty or of utter fraud could fragments of the true cross of jesus really be among us today could fragments of a tree survive millennia or are they fragments of forgery that speak to our need to believe the true cross phenomenon begins with emperor constantine the first roman emperor to convert to christianity he sent his mother saint helena c 246330 ce to find jesus objects in the holy land when helena traveled to jerusalem in 326 ce the city was still suffering the destruction caused by the last jewish war in 13235 ce after defeating israel roman emperor hadrian built a pagan temple over jesuss tomb near calvary  a grave insult to the new religion helena ordered this pagan temple torn down and began to dig beneath it to find relics related to jesus her workers found three different crosses  a discovery directly relating to the gospels which tell us that jesus was crucified along with two criminals the historian rufinus c 340410 reveals that in order to discern which cross was jesus helena had a dying local woman brought to the site the ill woman touched two of the crosses but nothing happened then she touched the third  and she recovered the true cross of jesus had been revealed helena carved it up leaving some of it in jerusalem and transporting a chunk to europe where it seemingly multiplied so much so that protestant reformer john calvin said  if all the pieces that could be found were collected together they would make a big shipload yet the gospel testifies that a single man was able to carry it but was calvin exaggerating to support his own reforms to catholicism how could we ever know what the true cross was made of or looked like since neither the gospels  nor the romans  bothered to tell us enter science in 1870 french architect charles rohault de fleury catalogued all known fragments of the true cross he determined the jesus cross weighed 165 pounds was three or four meters high with a cross beam two meters wide if all these bits of the cross were cobbled together he reckoned they wouldnt amount to a third of the cross on which jesus died and based on the fragments he was allowed to examine by microscope de fleury concluded the true cross was made of pine wood later four cross particles were also microscopically examined  part of ten pieces of the true cross accompanied by documentary proofs from byzantine emperors these fragments came from grand european churches santa croce in rome notre dame in paris and the cathedrals of pisa and florence but scientists discovered that they were all made of olive wood so now the question became was the cross of jesus made of olive wood or pine one of the perplexing realities for archaeologists is a lack of residual wood from the massive record of roman crucifixion despite the fact the romans killed tens of thousands of people through crucifixion  and as many as 500 a day during the siege of jerusalem from 6670 ce  the only piece of evidence connected to this terrible punishment was discovered in 1968 when archaeologists found the heel bone of a crucified man with the nail still intact in the israel museum in jerusalem israel hershkovitz who teaches anatomy and archaeology at tel aviv university said that the heel bone of the crucified man was found in a jewish burial tomb in a northern suburb of jerusalem near golgotha  the hill where the romans crucified people the man whose ossuary or burial box identified him as yehohanan was in his mid 20s when he died on the cross his good teeth and lack of heavy musculature meant that he most likely came from a wealthy family for most crucifixion victims were far too humble to wind up in tombs save for jesus who was put in one by the wealthy joseph of arimathea others buried in the same tomb as yehohanan had connections to the temple so its possible that he was killed by the romans for some political transgression yehohanan was cut down from the cross with a 45inch nail still in his right heel bone and with part of a board still attached to the head of the nail hershkovitz believes that the relative shortness of the length of the nail reveals much about roman crucifixion methods the nail was too short to go through two heel bones so sure enough each foot was hammered separately to the cross hershkovitz is convinced that crosses were not made from olive trees because the people depended on the olive tree for food and wouldnt be slashing them down to make crosses more importantly for the purpose at hand they wouldnt be suitable because of the structure of the tree itself olive trees dont grow tall and straight it branches everywhere and there are a lot of holes in the wood making it difficult to support the nails against the weight of the victim the olive tree is the least appropriate tree we have different type of local oaks that better serve the purpose today there are even more true cross fragments on display around the world on mount athos in rome in brussels in venice in ghent in paris in spain in serbia  and even in boalsburg pennsylvania where a fragment of the true cross came along as part of the family chapel imported there and rebuilt by theodore boal for his french bride if you want your own sliver of the cross on which jesus died ebay offers several choices  with some having original wax seals preserving integrity and some having documents attesting to their authenticity mark goodacre a professor at duke universitys department of religion says that this continued emphasis on the genuineness of true cross fragments is often at the expense of the crosss meaning the thing about the cross is youve always got to remember that its about the person who hung there the wood itself in the end is just the instrument of torture michael mckinley is coauthor with david gibson of finding jesus faith fact forgery six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels",
        "summ": "The article discusses the various claims surrounding fragments of the cross on which Jesus is said to have been crucified. Scientists have been unable to determine definitively what the cross was made of, or whether any of the fragments currently on display are genuine. The author argues that the focus on the authenticity of the fragments detracts from the meaning of the cross itself."
