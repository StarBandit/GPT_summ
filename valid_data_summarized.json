        "article": "cnn most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems the cockpit is our safe place the flight deck is a structured world of black and white checklists procedures standardization stress from the job is an accepted part of our career however sometimes during the course of an airline pilots career or anyones career for that matter stress issues may manifest as depression depression is treatable and for airline pilots it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood the federal aviation administration now approves certain prescribed medication allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor as the world learns more about andreas lubitz the copilot on germanwings flight 9525 it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression he reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness but lubitzs illness didnt just appear out of thin air  its effects had to be apparent to others lubitzs girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge  unfortunately after events took their course considering the hoops lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a germanwings copilot its curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed to what hoops am i referring first lets start with his passion for gliders glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor the sport involves teamwork interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety im a glider pilot participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent second lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through lufthansas flight program a requirement of germanwings employment the selection process is most likely highly competitive requiring aboveaverage aptitude is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed regardless the process had to be a stressful experience opinion germanwings and the stigma of mental illness  once accepted into the flight program a rigorous training period began for primary training lufthansa utilizes an ab initio from the beginning program based at a facility the airline owns in goodyear arizona near phoenix the training is geared toward a multicrew pilot license or mpl recognized by the international civil aviation organization the purpose of an mpl is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers countries that dont have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license airline pilots in the united states are not licensed in this manner requiring as much as 1500 hours to qualify as a copilot this is a fairly recent change in faa regulations initiated as a result of the 2009 colgan airlines crash in buffalo new york lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror as a 21yearold flight instructor i had that much flight time it hardly qualified as a lot of experience as with all of the mpl programs the training involves an intense period of airlinespecific instruction and to add insult to injury candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride regardless the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about 76000 using both actual flight experience in a singleengine airplane and simulator time the student receives about 250 hours of training it is a period of almost constant supervision aside from observing and checking performance criteria wouldnt at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment and wouldnt a fellow trainee have noticed also according to reports lubitz took a leave from his training  a very untypical behavior was that not in and of itself a red flag  wouldnt a manager in lufthansas flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues after all the selection process was most likely highly competitive with other qualified candidates readily available once the primary training in arizona was complete lubitz would have returned to germany and completed more specific schooling on the airbus a320 he was about to fly again no one observed issues but even more curious according to reports lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to lufthansa over the course of a career an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues even if we have never flown with a particular individual experience allows us the intuition to know when something isnt quite right that determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines or perhaps through a simple conversation in that regard i find it difficult to believe that none of lubitzs colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time as supplemental background germanwings had been established as the lowcost alter ego carrier of lufthansa depending upon a pilots monthly flight time salary for pilots can be as much as 20 lower than the mainline carrier in addition more days on duty were part of a germanwings crew members schedule apparently as late as march 20 lufthansa pilots had been on strike one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires perhaps enough of a disparity existed for germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered lubitzs absence regardless all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27yearold man the world knows the end result it just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen could it have been prevented well this is the primary purpose of accident investigation never allow the same tragedy to occur again",
        "summ": "The author suggests that the Germanwings crash could have been prevented if red flags surrounding the mental health of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had been noticed and addressed. Lubitz had several opportunities for his mental health issues to be discovered, including during his training to become a co-pilot and while working as a flight instructor, but none were apparently raised. The author argues that the combination of stressors in Lubitz's life, including a competitive selection process to become a co-pilot and less than ideal working conditions, may have contributed to his mental health problems."

        "article": "cnn easter is unique on the christian calendar a major point in the cycle of the religious year and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds christmas thats in part because easter is genuinely about how religious impulses and patterns can operate in ways that affect our lives nevertheless im often surprised by how little people even those supposedly within the christian tradition actually know about what is called holy week and its culmination on easter sunday   at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics and tolerance that have profound religious implications its worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday  and the awareness of the human condition in all its sadness and glory that it engenders after all holy week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent  still the fuss must puzzle those looking on wondering what it all means  why do christians make so much of this springtime week and make so much of easter weekend there is a phrase that many never come across even among christians  easter triduum  this refers to the three days of easter that begin with good friday proceed through holy saturday and conclude with easter sunday  its definitely a progression although the word itself  triduum  can refer to any three days of prayer easter triduum has a kind of major prologue in maundy thursday the day when by tradition jesus celebrated the last supper with his disciples in the upper room in jerusalem on the night before he was crucified  the idea of holy communion begins with this meal which was a passover meal jesus of course was jewish as were all his disciples  he was never trying to erase judaism and found a new religion  his work involved modifying and extending judaism in fresh ways on maundy thursday christians sometimes practice the washing of feet recalling that jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the last supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility  showing that he was himself a servant  and modeling a kind of ideal behavior good friday isnt in fact so good  its the day of the crucifixion when jesus was scourged and beaten forced to carry his cross to golgotha the place of the skull and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death  the actual scene of the crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel as do his last words assembled into the socalled seven last words of jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels some of these words are quotations as when jesus asked god why he has abandoned him  this is a quote from the 22nd psalm which opens  my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  good friday is a day of death sacrifice displacement fear holy saturday is probably the least understood day of the easter triduum  its a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of easter  this day occupies an anxious space in human experience when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isnt quite erased  cant be erased  simply by hope  its a day of depression a day of suspension then comes easter with the aura of the resurrection  im always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment when the body of christ becomes what is called a glorified body  this was not as ive said elsewhere the great resuscitation although thats part of it too  resurrection implies a total transformation something beyond the physical realm its very important that almost nobody who encounters jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him know him or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified  easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection with its promise of transformation  a shift from one form to another and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding the three days of easter the triduum occur only once a year on the calendar  but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again  we find ourselves emptied out in small ways nailed to our own trees in life embarrassed or broken by life it was the buddha who famously observed that life is suffering  good friday embodies the christian version of that truth  jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer  we must all die perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly  our friends and families must die  we all experience illness loss sadness a loss of confidence darkness  this is simply part of the human experience we dive again and again into holy saturday too  a period of transition when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view  we know well this inbetween time its an anxious passage with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope and weve all been resurrected again and again perhaps in tiny ways  this is the joy of easter and its not something reserved for one day on the calendar  its there whenever we experience what ts eliot once called the timeless moment which can only occur  paradoxically  in time itself  its a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time i suspect we all experience the triduum frequently sometimes more than once in a single day  but the ritual enactment of these three days of the easter season reminds all of those who practice christianity  and perhaps those who dont  that we should expect to move through darkness into light its a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression   its good cause for celebration too  and one that wont easily be coopted by secular culture",
        "summ": "The article discusses the religious holiday of Easter, and the three days that make up Easter weekend. Easter is a time for Christians to reflect on the suffering of Jesus Christ, and the hope of his resurrection.

thamel district it appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity he told cnn thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub this region is no stranger to earthquakes he said a lot of people had the same feeling this is a tremor it passed when that wasnt the case they were in uncharted territory its basically an unwritten book outside the coffee shop

said there was no chance that they survived nearby another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water nybo said a voice was heard coming from the rubble a group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a reenforced concrete wall to reach this guy it took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting

in nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage building codes in kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years he said efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but unfortunately this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the kathmandu valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to

the patrol car of north charlestons michael slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and scott slager approaches scotts vehicle the two men speak scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle slager then returns to his patrol car scott exits his vehicle briefly and slager tells him to stay in the car scott then gets out of the car again and runs away out of the range of the dash cam the video which was released thursday also shows a passenger in scotts car the passengers identity was not given in a police report obtained by cnn but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle scott family attorney chris stewart told cnn the man with scott was a coworker and friend he did not identify the friend by name when asked what might have motivated scott to run justin bamberg another attorney for the family speculated that scott might have been concerned about child support issues scott owed back payments on child support totaling 1810443 according to charleston county family court documents obtained by cnn he had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by slager but bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened this dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed mr scott  that shooting was completely unjustified and that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit the lawyer said the north charleston police department is not providing more information citing an ongoing investigation of scotts killing thats being conducted by the independent south carolina law enforcement division sled many questions remain about what happened on saturday when officer slager pulled scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight in the police report that cnn obtained a responding officer said that slager said that at one point he started to chase scott down a street shots fired and the subject is down the officer writes that slager said he took my taser but a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw scott try to get slagers taser feidin santana was walking to work when he saw slager and scott struggle on the ground he told nbcs lester holt on wednesday santana then took out his phone and started recording video i remember the police officer had control of the situation he had control of scott santana said then santana said he heard the sound of a taser it seemed to santana that scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the tasered again on thursday a second witness spoke to cnn about what she saw gwen nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and curious she followed them she saw scott and slager at the entrance to a vacant lot it was like a tussle type of thing like you know like what do you want or what did i do type of thing said nichols who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw i didnt hear mr slager saying stop  she said feidin showed the video to the scott family but santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape in interviews with msnbc and nbc santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video i  thought about erasing the video santana told msnbcs all in with chris hayes in an interview that aired wednesday evening i felt that my life with this information might be in danger the video shows slager shooting eight times at scott as scott runs away witness i nearly erased shooting video out of fear  an autopsy showed that scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body before the officer starts firing his gun in the video a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground its not clear whether that is the taser later in the video when the officer approaches scotts body he drops a dark object next to the man its also not clear whether that is the taser its unknown whether scott took the officers taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body slager has been fired and charged with murder he is white scott who was unarmed was black timeline of events  scotts shooting stirred memories of the michael brown case in ferguson missouri where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer a grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case but not everyone agreed that scotts case is like browns or that race was a factor asked how he felt about slager being charged with murder santana answered that no one can feel happy he has his family and mr scott also has his family he told holt but i think you know he made a bad decision  mr scott didnt deserve this and there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested and that wasnt the proper way to do that lessons learned from ferguson to north charleston  the fbi is investigating as is sled i have watched the video and i was sickened by what i saw north charleston police chief eddie driggers told reporters wednesday mayor keith summey spoke at the same news conference which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted no justice no peace they called for the mayor to step down summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras so every officer on the street in the city will have one that is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered he said just before the conference was set to begin demonstrators walked in they were led by a man wearing a black lives matter tshirt who shouted this is what democracy looks like 2010 census data show that north charleston is 47 black and 42 white the makeup of the citys police department is unclear though its been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 black three of 10 city council members are black its unclear what slagers motivation was or if race played a part in scotts slaying we cant get into the brain of another individual so we cant state that scott family attorney stewart said i think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature if convicted slager could face life in prison or the death penalty who is officer slager an autopsy of scott showed that he sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and his death was the result of a homicide the charleston county coroners office said asked whether cpr was performed on scott after slager shot him driggers said in the end of it the video what i saw was what i believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of lifesaving procedure but im not sure what took place there when scotts brother anthony saw the video he was convinced slagers account of what happened was not true he told cnn there was not a struggle for the taser anthony scott said i didnt believe my brother would have done that anyway to  anthony scott the videotape shows his brother was running for his life away from the officer i think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot no one would have thought that scott said family members have adamantly repeated that they dont want protests over scotts slaying to become violent and so far the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful scotts mother judy scott told cnns anderson cooper that she feels forgiveness in my heart even for the guy that shot and killed my son he was a loving

the sides are still talking whether your glass is halffull or halfempty it doesnt change the fact that its not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations nor does it change the fact that tuesdays selfimposed deadline didnt really matter anyway the date that really counts is june 30 when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal  with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out  or else everything falls apart the whole point of whats happening in lausanne switzerland is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement for those hoping that will eventually happen its good that iranian foreign minister javad zarif us secretary of state john kerry and senior european union diplomat helga schmid held talks early thursday morning in lausanne but it doesnt mean there will be a final deal we have made significant progress over the last few days but it has been slow going british foreign secretary philip hammond told reporters wednesday im optimistic that we will make further progress  but it does mean the iranians being willing to meet us where there are still issues to deal with fingers crossed and well hope to get there during the course of the day but by thursday morning there was still no deal zarif told reporters that iran has shown its readiness to engage with dignity and its time for our negotiating partners to seize the moment and use this opportunity which may not be repeated ive always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together they are mutually exclusive the iranian minister said so our friends need to decide whether they want to be with iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure they have tested the other one it is high time to test this one us state department official marie harf said on twitter that talks between kerry and zarif ran deep into the early hours of thursday morning that was truly an allnighter she tweeted around 6 am local time 12 am et saying the negotiations had broken up and would resume again in a few hours another us official had said earlier that some serious issues remain unresolved it is still totally unclear when this might happen if it happens at all theres one thing that most everyone does agree on the sides have made progress in recent days in fact zarif called it very good progress that led to solutions on most issues according to irna the staterun islamic republic news agency as long as the conversations continue to be productive white house press secretary josh earnest said us officials will keep on talking russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  whose country has been taking part in the talks along with germany france britain and the european union  went so far as to say with a large degree of confidence that framework agreements have been reached on all the key aspects of this issue at the ministerial level we hope that these agreements will be put on paper in the next few hours or a day at the most lavrov said before leaving the talks along with his counterparts from china and france the agreement stipulates a comprehensive approach to settling this issue including iaea verification of the exclusively peaceful nature of irans nuclear program and detailed provisions on lifting the sanctions but it doesnt matter if russia or germany is comfortable with the details the key is getting the united states and iran on the same page something thats hard given the decades of contempt and distrust  according to an irna report zarif said only that he hopes a framework agreement will be drafted wednesday i think its a matter of political will its not just about technical details anymore said fawaz gerges a professor of middle east studies at the london school of economics youre talking here about an institutionalized relationship of hostility between the united states and iran even then gerges on wednesday gave the sides a 60 to 70 chance of coming to some sort of preliminary agreement soon his reasoning i think there is a convergence of interests between obamas administration and the iranian leadership and thats why both camps have a vested interest in signing an agreement as opposed to walking away for iran which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes a deal would mean relief from punishing economic sanctions for the west it would offer hope of improved relations with tehran without the destabilizing threat of an iranian nuclear bomb in the pipeline the sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years thats why iran is facing crippling sanctions in the first place because many world powers felt they could not trust tehran given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks the tone changed with the 2013 election of iranian president hassan rouhani a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions and there has been some movement including in recent days out of iran still its too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything mohammad marandi a professor of north american studies at tehran university told cnn that iranian officials feel theyve already compromised a lot in the talks they feel that theyve gone as far as they possibly can and that its for the americans right now to make a move he said 21 questions on iranian nuclear talks  the main sticking points at the moment are believed to be the pace at which un sanctions on iran will be lifted how much nuclear research and development iran will be able to maintain and whether iran will ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for reprocessing into a safer form even if those points are resolved to the satisfaction of all sides any agreement is expected to come under attack on multiple fronts obama is likely to face a stern challenge selling any deal to congress while hardliners in iran will probably denounce it for being too harsh the leader of israel a key us ally that considers iran to be an existential threat on tuesday said the agreement that is being formed in lausanne is paving the road to that result and on wednesday israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu obliquely suggested that the united states could be threatened as well the middle east is plagued by antiwestern antidemocratic and antiamerican extremism  despots lead their people in chants of death to america while building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach america in this violent and unstable region where states are exploding said netanyahu referring to some iranian leaders and reports that iran could develop intercontinental missiles irans power rises with or without deal  obama administration officials say that any agreement would involve heavy monitoring of irans nuclear activities they insist no deal would be better than signing a bad deal but if no agreement is reached and the talks fall apart the potential consequences are deeply unsettling further sanctions on iran would most likely follow israel argues that could eventually force tehran back to the negotiating table to settle for a tougher deal but obama administration officials say they fear iran will redouble efforts to advance its nuclear program without any meaningful international inspections iranian progress toward a nuclear weapon could spark an arms race in the middle east and talk of military strikes from the united states or israel the military option will remain on the table us defense secretary ashton carter told nbcs today show on tuesday if there is a good agreement to have obviously its worth waiting for and completing the negotiations cnns elise labott reported

        "summ": "The deadline for an endgame pact on Iran's nuclear program has come and gone without a deal, but the sides are still talking. The date that really counts is June 30, when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out, or else everything falls apart. The talks in Lausanne, Switzerland are meant to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement.

hopefully finish their exhausting run monday the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways more public safety officials throughout the route a finish line area that prohibits large bags national guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security  those are the most obvious visible changes  and there are less obvious ones too with the luxury of some time and healing the city has moved on and that is a blessing in the midst of that weeklong tragedy  the bombings the manhunt the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the tsarnaev brothers  we thought we knew what was going on but we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness the fog of war sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions that narrative is just forming and its worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week as a former homeland security adviser for massachusetts i was intimately involved with the marathon planning as a commentator for cnn i saw the story evolve during that week some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight others by various afteraction reports and assessments and others by the trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts on tuesday the trials sentencing phase will begin determining whether he will receive the death penalty in national security circles there is often a debate about whether the us judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials terrorism the argument goes is different from traditional crimes and our system of evidence and crossexamination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats even if this argument were valid in some context  where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain  the boston marathon trial made clear that the system does work what was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional prosecutors presented evidence defense attorneys challenged the witnesses the defendant chose not to testify a verdict was rendered its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases but also took the mythology maybe even the romanticism of terrorism out of the case it rendered tsarnaev a common criminal and that was a statement worth making recent reports about the shootout in watertown that friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt it is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of massachusetts transit police officer richard donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure maybe it was adrenaline maybe it was just the nature of the weapons what is clear  in watertown and in so many other police departments  is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now that is a dangerous gap and too many police departments are failing to address it we have a notion of boston strong coming from the attacks and the citys response i never loved the term mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have puritan stock and a kickass attitude that is only partially true we risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a keep calm persona i have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response the quick decisions to move runners off boylston street the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers it is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only one part of the response that doesnt get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks runners had no access to phones and often had no identification family members of runners often didnt know where their loved ones were on the marathon route first responders in particular the boston police and the red cross focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to commonwealth avenue a few blocks from the finish line once family members know that they are with loved ones the trauma subsides they often leave the scene freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster is my family ok obviously there is so much more to learn could the bombing have been avoided what would have happened if the fbi had shared information it had on the tsarnaev family with local police what if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers its woulda coulda shoulda but still essential one of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isnt simply for blame but to get better for the next time analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient but do not believe that we are done learning looking back can be risky its often called the blinding clarity of hindsight because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror but i have no doubt that at future anniversaries what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written and maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead",
        "summ": "The author reflects on the lessons learned from the Boston Marathon bombings, specifically highlighting the importance of competency in responders and the need for better training for police officers. The author also notes that the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a vindication of the U.S. judicial system's ability to handle these types of cases. Looking back on the events of that week, the author concludes that there is still more to learn in order to be better prepared for future tragedies."

such as enemy forces and adversaries to refer to protesters according to documents obtained by cnn the guard came to ferguson to support law enforcement officers whom many community leaders and civil rights activists accused of using excessive force and inflaming an already tense situation in protests that flared sporadically from august through the end of the year the national guards language contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a freedom of information act request is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers actions in putting down riots they broke out after the august 9 shooting of unarmed black teenager michael brown by city police officer darren wilson a grand jury declined to indict wilson in the case its disturbing when you have what amounts to american soldiers viewing american citizens somehow as the enemy said antonio french an alderman in st louis the documents obtained by cnn also detail that the missouri national guard was concerned about perceptions of its deployment with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters and the communications show them calibrating the timing of their deployment in november  in anticipation of the st louis county grand jurys decision on whether to indict wilson  to try to ensure that their presence didnt further dial up tensions though several community members voiced concern that they were not deployed quickly enough we are deliberately constraining mobilization timelines to the last couple days to minimize backlash from calling up the ng early col david boyle army chief of staff at the missouri national guard informed his officers in a nov 18 email we have coordinated for lower profile less confrontation likely mission sets to emphasize support roles and minimize public militarization perception additionally some in the national guard seemed worried the language in the mission briefings could be problematic days before the announcement of the grand jurys decision an email from boyle warned of potential consequences from using language that could be construed as potentially inflammatory two days after that notification was sent to commanding officers stating that all reference of enemy were changed to state criminal elements still national guard spokesman capt quinn defended the militarized language as standard for the planning process ahead of deployment in an email to cnn he said the documents used in the ferguson mission briefings were a generic military planning format utilized in a wide range of military missions so the term enemy forces would be better understood as potential threats often in guard operations threats would include inclement weather heat failing levees etc in further comments emailed to cnn late friday after the initial version of this article appeared quinn insisted that while the term enemy forces appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission and claimed that the language was changed well ahead of the grand jurys decision but internal communications from as early as aug 14 through nov 18 when the directive was issued to change the inflammatory language show numerous uses of the terms that were sent to a large number of national guard commanders and leadership though the national guards actions throughout the fall did not elicit the type of complaints that were directed at the police some in ferguson were displeased that the guardsman didnt do more to act against looters and vandals ferguson mayor james knowles criticized the guard at a november 25 news conference saying that unfortunately as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed the national guard was not deployed in enough time to save all our businesses quinn in his comments to cnn responded that it would not have been part of the national guards mission to confront those destroying businesses rather the force would have stood guard at sites of unrest while law enforcement officers entered looted businesses and arrested suspects the documents reveal that the missouri guard was especially concerned that adversaries might use phone apps and police scanners to expose operational security counterintelligence operations are directed at supporting an information campaign their audience does not require the information to be accurate and is easily swayed one document read a document titled operation showme protection ii which outlines the missouri national guards mission in ferguson listed players on the ground deemed friendly forces and enemy forces among groups characterized as hate groups were the kkk the rgb black rebels and the new black panther party but also general protesters the document read protesters have historically used molotov cocktails rocks and other debris to throw at police several small arms fire incidents have occurred some elements may utilize militants sic tactics taught by usper rgb black rebels a communication specifying the types of gear and dangers the soldiers were likely to face warned that rioters likely have constructed homemade protection like goggles gas masks and plywood shields further select individuals may have bullet proof vests and may carry firearms it further noted that a possible method of attack is the use of molotov cocktails against personnel and equipment also the possibility exists of the use of arson for destruction and disruption of the power grid through targeted attack in addition to analyzing the threat general protesters could pose to soldiers the national guard also briefed its commanders on their intelligence capabilities so they could deny adversaries the ability to identify missouri national guard vulnerabilities upon which threat forces may exploit causing embarrassment or harm to the

that kept him busy after leaving school at 15 these days his mara group spans over 20 countries and hes been called africas youngest billionaire in late 2013 thakkar joined forces with the former boss of barclays bank  bob diamond  to start an investment fund focused on africa called atlas mara the powerful duo raised 325 million through a share flotation  well above the 250 million target but his vision spans beyond africa and earth  thakkar was the first african to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with richard bransons company virgin galactic cnns marketplace africa spoke to thakkar about african innovation entrepreneurship and collaboration an edited version of the interview follows cnn  you are active in several african countries how is the current business landscape on the continent ashish thakkar right now in the last 18 years i have been active on the continent i have never seen so much global excitement around africa that ive seen today the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved unfortunately its one of those cases where perception is so different from reality the reality on the ground is so much better than the perception youve got to remember as africa we are 54 countries some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit cnn why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the african continent at we have a very young demographic  85 of our populations are under the age of 35 we have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture yet entrepreneurship is not in the education system where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance and its something frankly that i am extremely passionate about because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants etc its going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises so its great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system and innovation is totally embedded into that cnn what is it about africa that encourages innovation at the biggest advantage we have at the moment and youve seen this with mobile phone penetration is that we dont have legacy systems we didnt have landlines and we didnt need them we didnt have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere we leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony today we have over 750 million phones on the continent  more than north america and western europe put together we can actually leapfrog in so many different ways mobile money is another brilliant example mobile money was created in kenya the whole concept of having money on your phone which is the best thing because its secure its practical made more sense so these kind of innovations youre going to see a lot more of on the continent i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that theyre coming up with is just so inspiring cnn what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur whos just starting out at entrepreneurship is a journey its not a destination there are going to be so many challenges you are going to get knocked down so many times but youve got to get up dust yourself off and get back to it the persistence the passion and staying on course is very crucial youll be tempted to cut corners youll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker but it never lasts people say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow  were not were the leaders of today but its our responsibility to take the seat at the table cnn what needs to be done most urgently to grow african economies at panafrican collaboration is extremely important i think things like regional integration interafrican trade does need to increase and is increasing i mean the progress in the east african community has been amazing the manner in which theyve harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic so we need to see more of that take place on the continent the fact that were 54 countries yet were a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage i think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial cnn are you confident about the future of the continent at i am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership the mindset of our leaders it is so inspiring to see that its unfortunate that you know globally the highlight remains things like ebolathe little issues that we do have are just magnified yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing cnn is this africas century at maras logo is the african lion and our little joke which a lot of people dont appreciate hence i love it even more is that the indian tiger and the chinese dragon have had their days and its now the african lions turn and it genuinely is  this is our turn more from marketplace africa  read this africas green lean speed machines

with women  young old black white asian and latina  working in their gardens taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world clinton who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007 is barely in the video at all appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others im getting ready to do something too im running for president clinton said in the video everyday americans need a champion and i want to be that champion  so you can do more than just get by  you can get ahead clinton often says theres no better time in history to be born female than the present shes now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nations first woman president the challenge for clinton in breaking the highest hardest glass ceiling that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics there are historic numbers of women in congress and the idea of leaning in is a catch phrase among professional women meanwhile the feminism label doesnt seem as charged as it once was  people from beyonce to actor joseph gordonlevitt are identifying as feminist as far as the political culture and culture in general this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office there is a willingness now to promote prowomen messages said jennifer lawless who runs the women  politics institute at american university  people are ready for a woman president  the question is this are they ready for hillary as that woman according to a recent pew poll nearly three quarters of americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime but that hope splits along partisan  not gender  lines only 20 of republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70 of democratic women do interactive hillary clinton tries again  in the runup to her announcement and at womencentered events clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song im every woman and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer she has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough she has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter charlotte as the reason she wants to remain in public life a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in iowa this week with small events she made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state as detailed in her book hard choices her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women with clinton in a blue cloth coat holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on the emphasis on women  and the progress of women  as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy which stressed experience and competence over history but the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasnt possible and didnt make for good politics she is the gender card  she doesnt need to play it because she embodies it she is the woman candidate she has shared womens experiences being a mom and a grandmother said democratic pollster celinda lake  she will just naturally bring it in if she overplayed it which she wont it could backfire republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the obama years  the wayne lapierre the national rifle associations president put it this way at the groups recent annual meeting eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough speaking on cnns state of the union sunday tennessee rep marsha blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didnt think it would be clinton theres a couple of things there trust honesty  those get in her way blackburn said as we talk about the polling that is out there that gets in hillarys way and shes not authentic in 2014 democratic candidates such as former colorado sen mark udall proved that the war on women style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits udall lost that race and picked up the nickname mark uterus along the way for his incessant focus on womens issues and democrats found that in states such as texas kentucky and georgia white married women and white working class women tended to prefer republicans katie packer gage who has been talking to women in focus groups about clintons run said that to many women the idea of hillary is more popular than the reality she starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth said packer gage who runs burning glass consulting a firm that coaches republicans on appealing to women voters you do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women but thats a narrow campaign not a winning campaign  you arent going to win 100 of women among republicans former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina might mount a challenge to clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first ladys strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men fiorina released a facebook video sunday in which she said clinton was a highly intelligent woman but doesnt have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness shes not the woman for the white house fiorina said and among democrats former virginia sen jim webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man a demographic that he has said is left out of the democrats increasingly diverse tent kentucky gop sen rand paul who launched his presidential campaign last week has noted that the clinton foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women suggesting that the prowoman framing wont be an easy sell but clinton will have some highprofile champions moments after her announcement top democrats rolled out endorsements including barbara mikulski the first democratic woman elected to the senate in her own right whoopee hillary is off and running she wrote in a statement im ready for hillary and america is ready for hillary she is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all at a recent emilys list event before announcing her run clinton asked her supporters dont you someday want to see a woman president in that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes but its unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches after all the answer across the country is much more complicated",

website the ncaa prominently states its our commitment  and our responsibility  to give young people opportunities to learn play and succeed and later it says that in the collegiate model of sports the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first athletes second but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes the lawsuit claimed the students didnt get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history in its response the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to studentathletes at its member institutions even with pages of online information about academic standards and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of studentathletes and the ncaa does not have direct daytoday operational control  over member institutions like unc its nonsense its double talk said gerald gurney a former athleticacademic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport if you look at their basic core principles its all about academics the experience the integration of academics and the education of the student is paramount gurney said they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement which read in part  the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaas role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist studentathletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field this case is troubling for a number of reasons not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every studentathlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them said donald remy ncaa chief legal officer in its response to the lawsuit it also likened its role to that of the american bar association or american medical association and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately the scandal at unc involved thousands of athletes who over 18 years were funneled into classes that never met where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports mary willingham the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though theyre academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required the system of eligibility that the ncaa brags about she says is a sham why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we cant legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway it makes no sense said willingham who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called cheated if they cant legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that then why certify students semester after semester to play its lost its meaning for me the ncaas claim that its handsoff when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years not just in the rhetoric on its website but in speeches by its president mark emmert and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes for example before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed obannon suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism insisting that college athletes are paid with an education thats the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by bigtime sports attorney jeffrey kessler seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value in response the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education consistent with its commitment to amateurism member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws attorney michael hausfeld who represented both obannon and now the unc athletes said this  this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaas shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that what we live for is the education of our athletes but the ncaas record tells a far different story but rick burton professor of sport management at syracuse university said its not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country i understand i think where the ncaa is coming from we would not let the ncaa come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university he said it sounds like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina and theres no logic to that he said the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the ncaa unc which was also sued has admitted to the fraud but also asked for a judge to throw out the case saying the athletes waited too long  seven years  to sue and the educational malpractice theory doesnt apply unc claims it is protected by state law this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal the ncaa which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from dangerous and exploitive athletic practices now says it does not enforce health and safety rules in fact in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 the ncaa wrote the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect studentathletes a cnn investigation found that the ncaa has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions  far behind even the nfl ramogi huma president of the national college players association and a leading thorn in the ncaas side for decades said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all theres nothing left the ncaa can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society one has to wonder what does the ncaa do if it doesnt protect players if it doesnt play a role in the education of college athletics it begs the question of why does the ncaa exist  and why does it have a tax exemption",

He explains that the region in which he has found such riches had gone unexplored because its so inaccessible. Just why so many settlements were simply abandoned long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors remains a mystery to which these long lost sites may provide an answer."

        "article": "cnn since the headlinegrabbing murder of american journalist james foley by isis militants eight months ago the world has been regularly confronted with a modern form of an ancient primally horrifying method of execution british and american aid workers japanese and american journalists kurdish and syrian soldiers and egyptian and now ethiopian christians were among those who followed in foleys wake their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated as propaganda to a global online audience these highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group  and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the isis cause but beyond this some experts such as psychology professor arie w kruglanski suggest the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knockon effect he says the spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copycat acts or threats of decapitation  not only from islamists but from the disbelievers they target kruglanski distinguished professor of psychology at the university of maryland says the frequent high profile reports of isis beheadings could result in psychologically priming people to be more inclined to emulate them or threaten to during moments of conflict or extreme stress because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally the very concept of beheading that was virtually nonexistent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated is now there he told cnn it comes to mind when a conflict happens when you react aggressively he said it sits there in our unconscious and can be activated under certain circumstances when the passions run high and result in actual behavior reports of beheadings also emerge from saudi arabia where it is a legal method of execution under the countrys judicial code and mexico and brazil where it is typically the work of criminal gangs but neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as isiss propaganda in which the threat is extended to disbelievers around the globe a similar copycat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings said kruglanski once the idea is planted then when someone is upset feeling violent the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes more readily to mind because its sitting there in our unconscious he said a lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are being carried out by nonjihadists more often but reports of such cases have been frequently making the headlines in december and january two victims were decapitated  outside a florida home and in a shopping mall in chinas shaanxi province  in crimes with no apparent connection to terror in london alone a city deeply impacted by the murder and attempted decapitation of soldier lee rigby by islamic extremists in 2013 three women were reportedly beheaded last year in alleged crimes with no apparent jihadist motivation and in the united states an oklahoma man is awaiting trial accused of beheading a coworker in september whether he was inspired by isis propaganda remains unclear he was reportedly a recent convert to islam and had posted osama bin laden and beheading content online whether or not nonjihadist beheadings are on the increase this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness as isiss beheadings have grabbed international headlines and the terror groups call on supporters to attack disbelievers has reverberated worldwide in australia and the philippines jihadrelated threats or plots to decapitate have allegedly been made in the past seven months recently a muslim convert in london was found guilty of a plot to behead a british soldier inspired by the rigby murder the theme of beheading was also front and center in an incident in belgium in january where fans of football team standard liege unfurled a giant banner depicting the severed head of an opponent the club condemned their actions as totally unacceptable beyond this threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among nonjihadists said kruglanski in the us a michigan man was arrested in january for threatening to decapitate the new york police officer who put eric garner in a fatal choke hold which triggered widespread civil rights protests and months earlier in october police reportedly received a threat to behead elementary school students in rhode island roderic broadhurst a professor of crime policing security and justice at the australian national university said the isis beheadings may have shown those engaging in attentionseeking threats of violence a sure way to get noticed an awareness of what really shocks and gets news is clearly on show he said the threats and banner demonstrated the way in which the spread of beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically brutalizing effect on society said kruglanski intensifying the violence of our thoughts words and actions ultimately were talking about contributing to the brutalization of interpersonal and intergroup conflict all over the planet he said justin hastings a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the university of sydney said that while isis beheadings might inspire some people to prefer that particular way to kill people as opposed to others he believed it would eventually fall out of favor while beheading had been adopted by isis as their stock in trade it would inevitably lose its shock value driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue capturing international attention one such dramatic escalation occurred in february when isis released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading was abandoned altogether for fresh horrors  burning jordanian pilot moath alkasasbeh alive in a cage later that month isis released a video released showing what appeared to be kurdish peshmerga fighters paraded down iraqi streets in cages for many a baffling aspect to the executions has been how such overweening brutality could win support for the isis cause while the executions are viewed by the vast majority of people as repellent kruglanski said they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers by projecting a sense of godlike power we all have this morbid instinctual fascination with death and killing and torture which is sublimated and constrained by civilization and our culture and socialization he said most of us are peaceful even though these drives exist in our subconscious civilization rests on its ability to constrain them but when the death instinct  this drive to kill and promote violence  was legitimized by a powerful narrative such as a religious or ideological call to global jihad then that can result in unregulated atrocities he said for some foreign jihadists who had traveled to iraq and syria to fight for isis the realities of the socalled islamic state had driven them to return home disenchanted he said but others remained in each of us there is this battle of good versus evil said kruglanski its a battle in everybodys soul",
        "summ": "The article discusses how the recent spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copy-cat acts or threats of decapitation from both Islamists and the \"disbelievers\" they target. It suggests that the frequent, high profile reports of ISIS beheadings could result in psychologically \"priming\" people to be more inclined to emulate them, or threaten to, during moments of conflict or extreme stress.

border al qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the united states and an end to drone strikes but it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages  take the case of jason rezaian the washington posts tehran bureau chief on april 20 just two days before diplomats resumed talks in vienna austria to reach a final agreement over irans nuclear program rezaians iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage conducting propaganda collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information with malicious intent the state department rezaians employers at the washington post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage their anger is justified but the decision should surprise no one there is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions humiliate the united states or signal unease the scale of irans current hostagetaking  not only rezaian but also iranianamericans saeed abedini and amir hekmati  may pale in comparison with iranian behavior of decades past but the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern consider the original iran hostage seizure on november 4 1979 radical students seized the american embassy in tehran ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days often forgotten was what sparked that episode which occurred more than nine months after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared the islamic revolution victorious the problem was a rush to reconcile at a november 1 1979 algiers reception zbigniew brzezinski president jimmy carters national security adviser met iranian prime minister mehdi bazargan according to brzezinskis own memoir he told bazargan that the united states was open to any relationship the islamic republic wanted photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world iranian hardliners meanwhile were apoplectic that barzagan was betraying irans revolutionary principles and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement khomeini endorsed their action our young people must foil these plots he reportedly said the hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands brzezinskis dream of reconciliation became a nightmare iran released the embassy hostages as ronald reagan took his oath of office ending its first but not last hostagetaking episode iranian proxies seized a number of americans in lebanon reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the nicaraguan contras the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also much as with obamas outreach today to solidify the moderate camp within the iranian political spectrum initially the scheme worked but no sooner had american officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free then kidnappers seized three more americans hostagetaking had simply become another way to collect concessions of course iran is not alone in such games whenever the united states tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold it faces hostage crises take north korea obama campaigned as the antibush on the world stage the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them  is ridiculous obama then a senator declared in july 2007 obama hadnt even marked two months in office when north korea detained two journalists working for al gores current tv a kangaroo court sentenced laura ling and euna lee to 12 years in prison it was traditional hostage diplomacy former president bill clinton traveled to pyongyang to appeal for their release north korean leader kim jong il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor kim jong un north koreas police force put out word that general kim jong uns artifice let former us president clinton cross the pacific to apologize to the great leader it was all made possible thanks to general kim jong uns extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics north koreas deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance ling and lee were neither the first nor the last americans that north korea seized during the obama era after north korea torpedoed a south korean ship killing 46 obama sought north koreas censure in the un security council pyongyang responded by threatening aijalon mahli gomes an american imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering north korea on cue former president jimmy carter arrived to mediate for gomes release called for new talks and by omission derailed efforts to hold north korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen south korean sailors the pattern would repeat in 2012 when north korea seized kenneth bae an american whom kim jong un sought to leverage into concessions the following year north korea arrested an 85yearold korean war veteran touring the hermit kingdom and the next year took two other tourists hostage each arrest resulted in a highlevel visit an apology to north korea that bolstered the dear leaders claims of strength and renewed engagement saddam hussein likewise worked from the same playbook in march 1995 iraqi security forces seized two american defense contractors who strayed into iraq from kuwait sentenced to eight years they served 114 days before rep bill richardson dnew mexico a close clinton ally and future cabinetlevel un ambassador flew to baghdad to retrieve them the american media lauded richardson but his trip was not without cost saddam used it to depict iraq as strong and america as weak president saddam hussein  accepts the pleas by bill clinton the congress and american people the iraqi news agency reported and so did the taliban fifteen years before obama traded alleged american deserter bowe bergdahl for five highvalue taliban and alleged al qaeda operatives imprisoned at guantanamo bay the taliban arrested two americans female missionaries their detention  and threatened death sentence  came against the backdrop of clintonera attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the taliban the taliban too knew how holding americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions so what does irans hostage brinkmanship portend diplomats drink their own koolaid and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold ego ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries hostages such as rezaian are canaries in the coal mine however their captivity  not suave officials and their smooth promises  show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy",

The article argues that this is part of a consistent pattern, and that the current hostage crisis in Iran should be no surprise.

concerns filled our sunday trip around the inside politics table 1 watch the volume as omalley uses youtube to test clinton pokes  slowly but clearly former maryland gov martin omalley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton how aggressive will he get stay tuned  literally cnns jeff zeleny says omalley enjoys using youtube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion  and question moves by clinton like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain drivers licenses every time hillary clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from 08 to 16  her statement on the drivers licenses that we discussed and other things  martin omalley has been releasing a youtube video showing a speech where he has done something different so watch for that to continue said zeleny those youtube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race the liberals love them 2 the obama factor clinton finds a lot to love and some distance  hillary clinton is a big fan of president obamas health care law but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style so reports aps lisa lerer who was in iowa this past week for the clinton campaign rollout and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime obama 2008 rival who of course went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state she embraced key portions of his legacy  coming out strong for the health care law for his push for immigration legislation  but it wasnt all sunshine and light said lerer she also took subtle digs at his leadership style she said america was on the wrong track i cant believe im saying this but at times she sounded almost like a republican 3 in big policy choice clinton signals an important campaign focus  in democratic politics kamala is the harris sister who gets the most national buzz but maya harris is about to play a big role in the question of how hillary clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes kamala harris is the california attorney general and a 2016 senate candidate for the seat being vacated by democrat barbara boxer maya harris just signed on for a top policy role in the clinton campaign  and cnns niamalika henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message one clue i think is maya harris said henderson her resume is really a liberals dream  she has worked at the center for american progress aclu shes also done work on community policing and police reforming and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate so i think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that hillary clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color who are so crucial to getting the obama coalition back together again 4 walkerrubio rubiowalker a general contrast with some gop buzz  marco rubio drew a direct generational contrast with hillary clinton when he officially joined the gop 2106 race and wisconsin gov scott walker also often talks of his hope republicans will look for a nextgeneration leader as their next presidential nominee in political circles  meaning among junkies and strategists  there is constant debate about potential tickets  at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail but jonathan martin of the new york times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a walkerrubio pairing is not limited to inside the beltway chatter they both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that clinton and gore did  in 1992 said martin but whats interesting is in new hampshire over the weekend i was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates for the first time from an actual activist  not an operative but an activist  i heard somebody float the idea of a walkerrubio race in 2016 5 iowa new hampshire south carolina and then heading into the 2016 cycle the republican national committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less frontloaded now some big gop establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe  especially texas sen ted cruz iowa new hampshire and south carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar florida is usually the next big contest but it could be eclipsed by  sports fans will get this  what is becoming known as the sec primary it is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress but what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a super tuesday  or maybe backtoback tuesdays  in early march that include a number of conservative southern states alabama arkansas tennessee texas georgia maybe louisiana the shift is one reason former arkansas gov mike huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008 ditto for rick santorum they did well in the south but it didnt matter much because john mccain and mitt romney respectively were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted again there might yet be more changes but more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best

        "article": "washington cnn chief justice john roberts is back in the spotlight roberts  who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold obamacare  once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case the us supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry the question at the core of obergefell v hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting samesex marriage but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nations highest court led by roberts appointed to the bench by president george w bush roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to samesex marriage he dissented in united states v windsor a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act which denied federal benefits to lawfully married samesex couples and hes expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow samesex marriage bans yet both sides see the case as a legacymaking moment for the 60yearold chief justice and advocates for samesex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how hell vote  and whether he will upset some conservatives once again if the windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the roberts court said judith e schaeffer of the constitutional accountability center which is advocating for samesex marriage will john roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision for some conservatives a vote in favor of samesex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice david souter who was nominated to the bench by george hw bush and who retired in 2009 consistently voted with the liberals or when justice anthony kennedy a ronald reagan appointee disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty or when roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the governments taxing authority the hope in conservative circles is that roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of samesex marriage gets decided by the people not the courts the chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the constitution said edward whelan president of the ethics and public policy center blatherings about the wrong side of history are an appeal to intellectual cowardice those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the windsor case in his majority opinion kennedy said the principal purpose of the defense of marriage act was to impose inequality roberts disagreed he wrote separately to say he thought congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide uniformity and stability at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman roberts picked up on kennedys language that emphasized the states power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions david cruz of the university of southern california gould school of law said that roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the obergefell case roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding samesex couples from marriage cruz said indeed the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in michigan tennessee ohio and kentucky in the obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage another clue to roberts thinking in the windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the defense of marriage act was passed out of a desire to harm  noting it had the support of majorities in both the house of representatives and the senate as well as president bill clinton who signed it into law i would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry roberts wrote the comments suggest he would reject an argument in the obergefell case that rested on the idea that samesex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people but backers of samesex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own schaeffer points out that roberts didnt join the parts of the dissents penned by justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and samuel alito which clearly stated a belief that state bans on samesex marriage dont violate the constitution roberts didnt join them in expressing those views schaeffer said at the time roberts simply wrote that the court does not have before it and the logic of its opinion does not decide whether states can ban samesex marriage schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasnt before the court but i think one reasonable explanation is that roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality she said the defense of marriage act decision overshadowed another 2013 case  hollingsworth v perry  that could have determined whether states could ban samesex marriage the case concerned a challenge to californias proposition 8 a state constitutional amendment that barred samesex couples from marriage but roberts writing for the majority dismissed the case holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated proposition 8 and thus paved the way for samesex marriage in california roberts lesbian cousin who lives in california sat in the courtroom during arguments in the prop 8 case few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the supreme court but waves of lower court judges  sometimes citing windsor  struck down the state bans on the first day of the term last fall the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases but conventional wisdom was completely wrong without comment the court declined to take up any of the cases clearing the way for thousands of additional samesex marriages the courts vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known but some speculate on one possible scenario roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in windsor then again even if the speculation were true it doesnt reveal much about roberts thinking theres a big difference between voting not to take up a case which expresses no opinions on the merits and issuing an opinion on the merits and even when roberts actions  such as effectively allowing samesex marriage to proceed in california  seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking when the institution of marriage developed historically people didnt get around and say lets have this institution but lets keep out homosexuals  roberts said during the proposition 8 oral arguments the institution developed to serve purposes that by their nature didnt include homosexual couples",

was a mantra he invoked repeatedly the poor were blessed and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the welltodo to enter paradise  meanwhile jesus told his twelve apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support so how did this wandering band of  firstcentury evangelists support themselves clearly money was a concern and not just as an impediment to salvation in the new testament money gets 37 mentions while gold gets 38 citations silver merits 20 and copper four coin comes up eight times and purse and denarii  the roman currency  get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the new testament  as the gospel of john tells it six days before passover jesus was in bethany at the house of his friend lazarus whom he had raised from the dead a woman named mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining jesus she dries his feet with her hair an irresistible image for artists and dramatists judas iscariot objected to the act why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor judas asks though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer jesus told judas to leave her alone and foreshadowing his fate said the anointing would be useful for his burial and besides you always have the poor with you  but jesus would not always be there what that passage makes clear is that the jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive so how much i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level rabbi joshua garroway a professor of early christianity and the second commonwealth at hebrew union college in los angeles jesus and his disciples walked wore what they had slept outside or in stayed in friends homes they ate what they caught or what others shared i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of jesus and the companions with whom he traveled garroway said garroway said that it was possible even likely that jesus and his followers received donations from supporters and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite  or perhaps because of  his preaching on the perils of wealth the gospel of luke gives us a glimpse of how jesus ministry functioned on a practical level  soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out  and joanna the wife of herods steward chuza and susanna and many others who provided for them  out of their resources so according to luke women whom jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their resources with mary magdalene and joanna capturing our attention  one by virtue of her husband and the other by her stature in the story of jesus joanna was an upperclass woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of herod antipas the son of herod the great the violent and ambitious head of judea as part of this volatile but powerful household joanna would be uniquely positioned to help jesus with her resources being both wealthy and having palace connections she attends to him during his life and the gospels tell us after his death as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty with her on that morning is mary magdalene also identified as  among other things  a financial supporter of jesus mary likely came from the prosperous town of magdala on the sea of galilee as home to a thriving fishing industry as well as dye and textile works mary could well have come from an affluent family  or have been a successful business woman herself mary magdalene was free to travel the country with jesus and his disciples so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home and in finding jesus we examine the gnostic gospel of mary magdalene and explore the argument that jesus was in fact her husband she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message and messenger not only was mary magdalene one of jesus most devoted followers who stuck with him all the way from galilee to jerusalem from the ministry to the cross and the tomb but also she provided for him from her own means said mark goodacre a professor of new testament and christian origins at duke university when the gospels speak of her ministering to jesus they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in jesus everyday mission goodacre continues along with other women like joanna and susanna she was one of those who made his mission viable along with these women men like joseph of arimathea and nicodemus both men of stature and wealth may have chipped in to help fund jesus ministry the gospels reveal that both these men were rich and supported jesus  indeed it was joseph who removed jesus from the cross on good friday anointing his body with the help of nicodemus and placing him in the tomb that joseph had reserved for himself after the resurrection on that first easter sunday the movement jesus started grew exponentially and the churchs relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater michael mckinley is coauthor with david gibson

talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater kent state university they came to me for career advice which i gave them but i also picked their brains about politics religion and marriage their views on marriage intrigued me the most cause guess what they dont care what your generation thinks  theyll get married if and when they want i didnt go to college for four years to be a mom 21year old candace monacelli told me theres no housewife degree ive worked my butt off for four years to get this degree you want to use it you want to be successful you want to have that happy part of your life as well jackie demate also 21 agreed i would have a very hard time justifying spending 20000 on a wedding when i could go to europe at first i thought jackie was kidding so jokingly i responded wow some people would say with that attitude you are undermining the moral foundation of this country jackie didnt blink but europe she exclaimed im really looking for a travel buddy and i dont think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone i see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone and i would rather be alone successful and happy than in a relationship where im not happy  im ok being single forever as long as im happy before you berate jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage consider where shes coming from a culture rich in divorce in the united states almost 42 million adults have been married more than once thats up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960 percentagewise that means that among adults who are currently married roughly a quarter 23 have been married before compared with 13 in 1960 what a fine example my generation is not still there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong especially in light of a fascinating pew research report on marriage when asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children 50 of respondents were ok with that and of that 50 66 were adults between 18 and 29 religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons economists are concerned for our collective future studies show marriage is correlated with economic wellbeing though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction a study sponsored by the conservative american enterprise institute says  from an obvious standpoint households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes improving wellbeing on the other hand the study points out people who have money may be more desirable marriage prospects bingo on that point the millennials i talked with prefer their partners to be debtfree and riding high they also dont want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt right now im 21 years old and im thousands of dollars in debt emily crille told me that wasnt something my parents bore and its really hard to plan a wedding or even think about something like that when you owe so much money you dont have a job and you dont have a home i felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes as a child of divorce i never wanted to get married either  until i met my husband at 38 but when i was in my twenties waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority i heard the whispers is there something wrong with her is she selfish unlovable perhaps it is selfish to establish a career travel and have a child on your own or maybe its exactly right scandinavians are just about there according to usa today in norway  82 of couples have their first child out of wedlock the numbers are similarly high for sweden and denmark while many couples marry after having the first or second child its clear marriage in parts of scandinavia is dying the article also points out that norway ranked first and sweden second in the united nations qualityoflife survey for 2004 which rates per capita income education levels health care and life expectancy in measuring a nations wellbeing the usa came in eighth in an effort to understand the joys of sambo the term for living together in scandinavia my producer reached out to mikael anteskog adler a 35yearold man from stockholm sweden to put it short he told us marriage costs money party clothes rings honeymoon trip etc and gives no significant advantages as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation wow fiftyyearold anne lehes from gothenburg sweden told my producer i believe that one reason for many swedes staying single is because this is a secular country so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner and inevitably they get disappointed and then they dont think the whole thing is worth it maybe christina hugosson of uppsala sweden sums it up best the notion that marriage is something that youre pressured into seems horrible to me  marriage should be for love not a matter of expectations routine and everyday practicalities my kent state millennials  true romantics  would agree wholeheartedly with hugossan emily told me as much marriage is about love its not about planning or timing and thats what were all kind of waiting for marriage is about love but you have to be good partners too and as they say sometimes love isnt enough which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse would it be so terrible if we all remained single if i had remained single i thought about it so did my husband we didnt plan to have children what was the point in the end we made a decision based on love and practicality a commitment would not only prove our love but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure eleven years later we have no regrets but we are not you and yours would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with i dos i dont know but i would love to know if you do",
